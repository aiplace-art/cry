## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue 1: Low Engagement Rates

**Symptoms:**
- Posts getting <5% engagement

- Low view counts

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check posting times
node src/bots/run-all-growth-bots.js --analyze-timing

# Analyze content performance
node src/bots/run-all-growth-bots.js --content-report
```

**Solutions:**
1. Adjust posting schedule to peak times
2. Increase content variety (more polls, questions)
3. Create more visually appealing content
4. Ask direct questions in posts
5. Reduce posting frequency (quality over quantity)

---

#### Issue 2: Bot Crashes or Errors

**Symptoms:**
- Bots stopping unexpectedly
- Error messages in logs
- Missing scheduled posts

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check logs
tail -f logs/growth-bots.log

# Check bot status
pm2 status telegram-growth-suite
pm2 logs telegram-growth-suite --lines 100
```

**Solutions:**
1. **Memory Issues:**
   ```bash
   # Increase memory limit
   pm2 start run-all-growth-bots.js --max-memory-restart 500M
   ```

2. **API Rate Limits:**
   ```javascript
   // Increase delays in config
   config.delays.betweenRequests = 5000; // 5 seconds
   ```

3. **Network Issues:**
   ```javascript
   // Add retry logic
   const retryOptions = {
     retries: 3,
     minTimeout: 1000,
     maxTimeout: 5000
   };
   ```

---

#### Issue 3: Telegram Warnings or Blocks

**Symptoms:**

```

**Solutions:**
1. **Immediately:**
   - Stop all automated posting
   - Review last 50 messages for spam patterns
   - Remove any repetitive content

2. **Then:**

   - Show your channel's value (metrics)
   - Keep it brief (3-4 sentences max)

2. **Better Targeting:**

---

#### Issue 5: High Member Churn

**Symptoms:**
- Members joining but leaving quickly
- Low retention after 7 days
- Decreasing engagement over time

**Diagnosis:**

   - Explain channel value in first message
   - Provide quick wins (valuable content in first hour)
   - Ask new members what they want to see

2. **Content Relevance:**
