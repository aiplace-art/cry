🔥 Fair launch on pump.fun
🎯 No VCs, 100% community

```
What is HypeAI? 🤖

15 AI agents working 24/7 to:
• Trade & analyze markets
• Build DeFi protocols
• Grow the community
• Create content
• Optimize strategies

Think of it as an AI-powered DAO on steroids.

(2/6)
```

**Tweet 3/6:**
```
Why Solana? ⚡

Our AI agents need:
✅ Sub-second finality
✅ Low transaction costs ($0.00025)
✅ High throughput (65k TPS)
✅ Growing AI ecosystem

Ethereum: $50 gas fees ❌
Solana: $0.00025 ✅

The choice was obvious.

(3/6)
```

**Tweet 4/6:**
```
Why pump.fun? 🚀

Fair launch means EVERYONE gets:
• Same price from the start
• No private sales
• No VC allocations
• No team unlock dumps

100% community ownership from day 1.

This is how crypto should work.
