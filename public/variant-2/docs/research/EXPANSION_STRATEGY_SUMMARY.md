### AVOID THESE MISTAKES

1. **DON'T Compete on Price**

   - Compete on DONE-FOR-YOU value, not DIY tools
   - Premium positioning: "We're 10x the price but 100x the value"

2. **DON'T Launch All 50 Agents**
   - Diminishing returns after 40-45 agents
   - Redundancy kills brand clarity
   - Focus on quality and specialization

3. **DON'T Ignore Compliance**
   - Financial advice, academic writing, audit services have regulations
   - Legal review is NOT optional
   - Professional liability insurance is essential

4. **DON'T Neglect Enterprise Sales**
   - B2C is volume, B2B is margin
   - Target mix: 60% enterprise, 40% B2C
   - Enterprise deals are 10-50x larger than B2C

5. **DON'T Abandon Crypto Focus**
   - Crypto/blockchain is your differentiator
   - Maintain current 27 agents in parallel
   - New services COMPLEMENT, not replace

6. **DON'T Expand Too Fast**
   - Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 with validation gates
