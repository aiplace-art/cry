## 2. LAUNCH PRICE STRATEGY

### üìä LAUNCH PRICE CALCULATION

**Recommended Launch Price: $0.006 per HYPE**

**Market Cap Analysis:**
- **Initial Circulating Supply:** ~50,000,000 HYPE (5%)
  - Team allocation (partially unlocked): 20M
  - Early presale unlocks: 15M
  - Liquidity pool: 15M
- **Launch Market Cap:** $300,000 (micro-cap positioning)
- **Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV):** $6,000,000

**Price Progression:**
```
Private Sale:    $0.0015  (75% discount from launch)
Presale Round 1: $0.003   (50% discount from launch)
Presale Round 2: $0.0045  (25% discount from launch)
LAUNCH:          $0.006   (baseline)
1 Month Target:  $0.009   (50% gain from launch)
3 Month Target:  $0.012   (100% gain from launch)
6 Month Target:  $0.024   (300% gain from launch)
```

**Justification:**
- $0.006 launch allows 2-5x ROI for all presale participants
