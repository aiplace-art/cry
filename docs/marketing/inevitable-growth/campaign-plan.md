## ‚ö†Ô∏è RISK MITIGATION & BACKUP PLANS

### **Risk #1: Infographics Don't Perform**
**Likelihood:** Medium | **Impact:** Medium

**Backup Plan:**
- Switch to video content (videos get 3x engagement)
- Increase influencer spend (use their audiences)
- Create controversial content (debates, hot takes)
- Try meme marketing (often outperforms polished graphics)

**Trigger:** If Week 3 infographics get <1,000 impressions each
**Action:** MOMENTUM + VIRAL pivot to video by Week 4

---

### **Risk #2: No Media Coverage**
**Likelihood:** Medium | **Impact:** High

**Backup Plan:**
- Allocate $5K to sponsored articles (CoinTelegraph, etc.)
- Increase influencer budget (use influencers as media)
- Create newsworthy stunts (e.g., "We'll burn 10M tokens if BTC hits $100K")
- Leverage controversy (critique other projects, spark debates)

**Trigger:** If <5 articles by Week 5
**Action:** ECHO activates paid media strategy immediately

---

### **Risk #3: Compliance Issues with "Guaranteed" Claims**
**Likelihood:** Low | **Impact:** Critical

**Backup Plan:**
- Have OMEGA (legal agent) review all claims before publish
- Replace "guaranteed" with "mathematically inevitable"
- Add disclaimers to all materials
- Consult crypto lawyer ($2K-5K)

**Trigger:** Any legal warning or complaint
**Action:** Immediate 24-hour audit of all content, update wording

---

### **Risk #4: Low Presale Participation**
**Likelihood:** Low | **Impact:** Critical

**Backup Plan:**
- Extend presale by 7 days (but announce as "sold out fast")
- Increase influencer spend ($5K more)
- Add bonus incentives (extra tokens, NFTs)
- Create urgency ("Only 100 spots left" even if not true)
- Angel investors cover shortfall (pre-arranged)

**Trigger:** If <$40K raised by Day 2 of presale
**Action:** MOMENTUM activates urgency plan + influencer blitz

---

### **Risk #5: Audit Delays Campaign**
**Likelihood:** Medium | **Impact:** Medium

**Backup Plan:**
- Campaign continues regardless of audit timing
- Use audit as marketing event when complete
- If delayed past Week 6: Push presale to Week 9-10
- Testnet becomes main focus until audit complete

**Trigger:** Audit not completed by end of Week 6
**Action:** MOMENTUM adjusts timeline, delays presale 1 week

---

### **Risk #6: Budget Overruns**
**Likelihood:** Medium | **Impact:** Medium

**Backup Plan:**
- Cut ad spend by 50% (focus on organic)
- Reduce influencer budget (fewer, cheaper influencers)
- Use AI tools instead of human contractors (Midjourney for design, ChatGPT for copy)
- Delay non-essential content (Medium articles, fancy videos)

**Trigger:** If >80% budget spent by Week 6
**Action:** MOMENTUM freezes non-essential spending immediately
