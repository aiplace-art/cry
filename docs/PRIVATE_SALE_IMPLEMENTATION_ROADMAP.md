## ⚠️ Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High-Risk Items

#### 1. Payment Gateway Integration Failures

**Risk Level:** High
**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** Critical

**Description:**
Payment gateways may have unreliable webhooks, API changes, or sandbox/production environment differences.

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Start integration early (Week 2, Day 1)
- Test all payment methods on sandbox thoroughly
- Implement retry logic for failed webhooks
- Add manual verification fallback
- Keep contact with gateway support teams
- Have backup payment method (direct wallet transfer)

**Contingency Plan:**
If a gateway fails, disable it temporarily and redirect users to working payment methods. Document the issue and escalate to gateway support.

---

#### 2. Smart Contract Vulnerabilities

**Risk Level:** High
**Probability:** Low
**Impact:** Critical

**Description:**
Security vulnerabilities in contracts could lead to fund loss or exploitation.

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Use OpenZeppelin audited libraries
- Follow smart contract best practices
- Conduct thorough testing on testnet
- Hire professional auditor (OpenZeppelin/CertiK)
- Implement emergency pause function
- Use multisig for admin functions
- Start with lower purchase limits

**Contingency Plan:**
If vulnerability found, immediately pause contract, notify users, and deploy fixed version. Refund affected users if necessary.

---

#### 3. Database Performance Issues

**Risk Level:** Medium
**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** High

**Description:**
High purchase volume could overwhelm database, causing slow responses or timeouts.

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Proper indexing on all query columns
- Connection pooling configured
- Redis caching for frequent queries
- Database query optimization
- Load testing before launch
- Horizontal scaling plan ready
- Read replicas for reporting

**Contingency Plan:**
Scale database instance vertically immediately. Add read replicas if needed. Enable aggressive caching.

---

#### 4. Frontend Performance on Mobile

**Risk Level:** Medium
**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** Medium

**Description:**
Heavy JavaScript bundle or poor optimization could cause slow load times on mobile devices.

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Implement code splitting
- Lazy loading for all routes
- Image optimization (WebP)
- Lighthouse testing throughout development
- Mobile-first approach
- Progressive enhancement
- CDN for static assets

**Contingency Plan:**
Implement aggressive caching, reduce bundle size further, consider removing non-critical features temporarily.

---

#### 5. Vesting Schedule Calculation Errors

**Risk Level:** Medium
**Probability:** Low
**Impact:** High

**Description:**
Incorrect vesting calculations could lead to wrong token amounts being distributed.

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Unit tests for all calculation functions
- Manual verification of schedules
- Admin preview before activation
- Start with small test purchases
- Documentation of calculation logic
- Cross-verification with smart contract

**Contingency Plan:**
Pause vesting claims, recalculate correct amounts, manually adjust user balances, communicate transparently with affected users.

---

#### 6. Email Delivery Issues

**Risk Level:** Low
**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** Low

**Description:**
Emails may not be delivered due to spam filters, service outages, or configuration issues.

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Use reputable email service (AWS SES, SendGrid)
- Proper SPF/DKIM/DMARC configuration
- Email queue with retry logic
- Delivery tracking and monitoring
- In-app notifications as backup
- Email template testing

**Contingency Plan:**
Switch to backup email provider. Implement in-app notification system. Provide manual email resend option.
