   - `whySucceed.longTermCommitment.*` (25 keys)
   - `agents.*` (35 keys)
   - `features.*` (18 keys)
   - `tokenomics.*` (25 keys)
   - `roadmap.*` (30 keys)
   - `walletModal.*` (9 keys)
   - `footer.working247`, `footer.agentsShowcase`, etc. (15 keys)

3. ‚úÖ Create Russian translations for all new keys

## SECTION 5: RISK ANALYSIS & MITIGATION

### 5.1 Risks

**Risk 1: Layout Breaks with Long Russian Text**
- **Probability:** High
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Mitigation:**
  - Use CSS with `overflow-wrap: break-word`
  - Test on narrow viewports
  - Add responsive font sizes

**Risk 2: Translation Keys Not Found**
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Impact:** High (English fallback looks unprofessional)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Use nested key checker during development
  - Add fallback handling in getNestedTranslation()
  - Test every single translation key

**Risk 3: Missing Context for Translators**
- **Probability:** Low
- **Impact:** Low
- **Mitigation:**
  - Add comments in translation JSON
  - Keep original English structure visible

**Risk 4: Performance Impact**
- **Probability:** Low
- **Impact:** Low
- **Mitigation:**
  - Translations are embedded (no network requests)
  - Modern browsers handle large JSON easily

2. All hero section text in Russian
3. All stats labels in Russian
4. ALL "Why Succeed" section in Russian (including long paragraphs)
5. ALL agent names, roles, and labels in Russian
6. ALL feature cards in Russian
7. ALL tokenomics labels and values in Russian
8. ALL roadmap items in Russian
9. ALL footer links and legal links in Russian
10. Wallet modal completely in Russian
11. No English text visible when Russian language is selected
12. No layout breaks or overflow issues
13. Smooth language switching (<100ms)

### 6.2 User Acceptance

**User Goal:** "–∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ –º—ã –≤–∫–ª—é—á–∞–µ–º —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π, –≤—Å–µ –¥–æ–ª–∂–Ω–æ –±—ã—Ç—å –Ω–∞ —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–º"
(When we turn on Russian, EVERYTHING should be in Russian)

**Acceptance Test:**
- User switches to Russian
- User scrolls through ENTIRE page from top to bottom
- User sees ZERO English text
- User opens wallet modal - sees Russian
- User confirms: "–î–∞, —Ç–µ–ø–µ—Ä—å –≤—Å–µ –Ω–∞ —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–º!" (Yes, now everything is in Russian!)

## SECTION 7: NEXT STEPS

### Immediate Actions (Priority Order):

1. **[HIGH PRIORITY]** Update language-switcher.js with 185 new translation keys
2. **[HIGH PRIORITY]** Add data-i18n to AI Agents section (~90 elements)
3. **[HIGH PRIORITY]** Add data-i18n to Why Succeed long text (~22 elements)
4. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY]** Add data-i18n to Features section (~18 elements)
5. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY]** Add data-i18n to Tokenomics section (~25 elements)
6. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY]** Add data-i18n to Roadmap section (~30 elements)

9. **[CRITICAL]** Full-page testing with Russian language enabled
10. **[CRITICAL]** Fix any layout or translation key issues

### Timeline:

- **Day 1 (4 hours):** Translation keys + AI Agents section
- **Day 2 (3 hours):** Features, Tokenomics, Roadmap sections
- **Day 3 (2 hours):** Footer, Wallet Modal, Testing, Bug fixes

**Total:** 8-10 hours for complete 100% Russian translation

## SECTION 8: CONCLUSION

**Current Gap:** ~185 untranslated elements (out of ~313 total)
**Translation Coverage:** Currently 38% ‚Üí Target 100%
**Effort Required:** 8-10 hours of focused development work

**Key Findings:**
1. Major sections (AI Agents, Features, Tokenomics, Roadmap) are 0% translated
2. "Why Succeed" section has many long untranslated paragraphs
3. Footer and Wallet Modal are partially/not translated
4. Systematic approach: Update JS translations first, then add data-i18n attributes
5. Testing is critical - Russian text is typically 15-30% longer than English

**Recommendation:**
Follow the 3-day implementation plan with rigorous testing at each phase. Prioritize high-visibility sections (AI Agents, Features) first, then complete remaining sections.

**Final Note:**
This architecture plan provides a complete roadmap to achieve the user's goal: "–∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ –º—ã –≤–∫–ª—é—á–∞–µ–º —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π, –≤—Å–µ –¥–æ–ª–∂–Ω–æ –±—ã—Ç—å –Ω–∞ —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–º" (when we turn on Russian, EVERYTHING should be in Russian). Following this systematic approach will ensure 100% translation coverage with zero English text visible in Russian mode.
