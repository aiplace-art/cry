## 🚢 Deployment

### Local Development

```bash
# Start local Hardhat node
npm run node

# Deploy to localhost
npm run deploy -- --network localhost
```

### Testnet Deployment (BSC Testnet - Recommended)

```bash
# Deploy to BSC Testnet
npm run deploy -- --network bscTestnet

# Verify contract on BscScan
npm run verify -- --network bscTestnet DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS

# Get testnet BNB
# Visit: https://testnet.bnbchain.org/faucet-smart
```

### Mainnet Deployment (BNB Chain - Primary)

```bash
# Deploy to BNB Smart Chain Mainnet
npm run deploy -- --network bsc

# Verify on BscScan
npm run verify -- --network bsc DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS

# Alternative: Deploy to Ethereum
npm run deploy -- --network mainnet
```

**📖 Detailed Guide:** See [BNB_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](docs/BNB_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)

## 🔐 Security

### Security Features
- OpenZeppelin battle-tested libraries
- ReentrancyGuard protection
- SafeMath for arithmetic operations
- Access control (Ownable)
- Trading pause mechanism
