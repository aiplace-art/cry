## 🎯 KEY FINDINGS

### ⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND

**Wrong Contract Deployed**
- Current: `/src/contracts/PrivateSale.sol` - NO vesting ❌
- Correct: `/src/contracts/vesting/HypeAIPrivateSaleWithVesting.sol` - HAS vesting ✅

**Impact**: Users receive all tokens immediately instead of vested over 21 months.

**Solution**: Deploy the correct contract with vesting.

---

## 📊 VESTING FORMULA VERIFIED

```
✅ Immediate Unlock: 20% of total tokens
✅ Cliff Period: 90 days (no vesting during this time)
✅ Linear Vesting: 80% over 540 days after cliff
✅ Total Duration: 630 days (21 months)
```

**Example ($1,000 purchase = 12,500,000 HYPE)**:
```
Day 0:   2,500,000 unlocked (20%)
Day 89:  2,500,000 unlocked (still in cliff)
Day 90:  Vesting starts
Day 180: 4,166,667 unlocked (33.33%)
Day 360: 7,500,000 unlocked (60%)
Day 630: 12,500,000 unlocked (100%)
```
