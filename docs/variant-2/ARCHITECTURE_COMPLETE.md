## Technology Decisions

### Why No Build Tools?

**Rationale:**
- Simplicity: Pure HTML/CSS/JS works everywhere
- Speed: No compilation step
- Accessibility: Lower barrier to entry
- Performance: No unnecessary overhead
- Maintenance: Easier to debug and update

### Why Vanilla JavaScript?

**Rationale:**
- Smaller bundle size
- Faster load times
- No framework lock-in
- Simpler debugging
- Lower complexity

**For a 28-page website:** Vanilla JS is the right choice.

### Why Component-Based?

**Benefits:**
- Reusability
- Consistency
- Maintainability
- Testability
- Scalability

**Pattern:**
```javascript
// ES6 class-based components
class StatsCounter {
  constructor(element) { }
  init() { }
  animate() { }
}
```
