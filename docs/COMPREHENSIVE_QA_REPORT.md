```

**Verification:**

## ⚠️ KNOWN LIMITATIONS (NOT BUGS)

### 1. Demo Data
**Impact:** Low
**Status:** Expected
All statistics are labeled "(Demo)" as smart contracts are in development. This is intentional and communicated clearly to users.

### 2. WalletConnect Integration
**Impact:** Low
**Status:** Planned
Shows "coming soon" message. MetaMask and Trust Wallet work fine.

### 3. Hamburger Menu Icon
**Impact:** Low
**Status:** Works, but simple
Mobile menu uses basic "☰" icon. Could be replaced with animated SVG icon in future.

### 4. Some Pages Not Created
**Impact:** Low
**Status:** Expected
Pages like `stake.html`, `governance.html`, `agents.html` are referenced but not yet created. This is normal for phased development.
