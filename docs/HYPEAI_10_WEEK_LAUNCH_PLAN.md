## 🚨 RISK MITIGATION

### Technical Risks:
**Risk:** Security exploit found after audit
**Mitigation:** Bug bounty program, gradual rollout, emergency pause function

**Risk:** Smart contract bug causes loss of funds
**Mitigation:** Insurance ($10M via Nexus Mutual), limit initial liquidity, testnet testing

### Market Risks:
**Risk:** Low interest, presale fails
**Mitigation:** Pre-build community to 10K+ before presale, guarantee minimum via angel investors

**Risk:** Competitors launch first
**Mitigation:** Speed to market (10 weeks aggressive), first-mover narrative even if second

### Execution Risks:
**Risk:** Miss 10-week deadline
**Mitigation:** Weekly milestones, hard deadlines, reduce scope if needed (MVP first)

**Risk:** Team burnout
**Mitigation:** 27 AI agents don't burn out 😉, but human founder should pace himself

### Regulatory Risks:
**Risk:** SEC classifies as security
**Mitigation:** Utility token positioning, legal review, avoid US marketing initially
