## Why the Change?

### 1. **Community First**
Traditional presales often favor early insiders and VCs. A fair launch on pump.fun ensures everyone has equal opportunity, building a stronger, more engaged community from day one.

### 2. **Solana Ecosystem Alignment**
Solana's high-speed, low-cost infrastructure is perfect for AI agents that need to execute trades and transactions rapidly. The ecosystem is also increasingly AI-native.

### 3. **Transparency & Trust**
By removing the presale model, we eliminate concerns about:
- Team token allocations
- Hidden vesting schedules
- Insider advantages
- Opaque tokenomics

### 4. **pump.fun Benefits**
- Proven fair launch platform
- Automatic liquidity creation
- Bonding curve price discovery
- Built-in community tools
- Lower barrier to entry
