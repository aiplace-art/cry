                <p>
                    HypeAI offers staking services that allow you to lock your HYPEAI tokens for specified periods in exchange for potential rewards. Staking involves significant risks and you should carefully review all terms before participating.
                </p>

                <h3>6.2 Staking Tiers and APY</h3>
                <p>
                    Current staking tiers (subject to change):
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>30-Day Lock:</strong> Up to 17% APY</li>
                    <li><strong>90-Day Lock:</strong> Up to 27% APY</li>
                    <li><strong>365-Day Lock:</strong> Up to 62% APY</li>

                    <strong>APY rates are variable and not guaranteed.</strong> Actual returns may vary based on protocol performance, market conditions, token supply, and other factors. Past performance does not guarantee future results.
                </p>

                <h3>6.3 Lock Period</h3>
                <p>
                    When you stake tokens:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tokens are locked for the selected period and cannot be withdrawn early</li>
                    <li>Attempting to withdraw before the lock period expires will result in forfeiture of rewards and may incur early withdrawal penalties</li>
                    <li>Lock periods begin at the time of transaction confirmation on the blockchain</li>
                    <li>Upon lock period expiration, you must manually withdraw your staked tokens and rewards</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>6.4 Staking Risks</h3>
                <p>
                    Staking involves significant risks, including but not limited to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Smart Contract Risk:</strong> Bugs or vulnerabilities in smart contracts could result in loss of staked funds</li>
                    <li><strong>Impermanent Loss:</strong> Token price may decrease during the lock period, resulting in lower USD value upon withdrawal</li>
                    <li><strong>Liquidity Risk:</strong> Staked tokens are illiquid and cannot be accessed during the lock period, even in emergencies</li>
                    <li><strong>Reward Variability:</strong> Actual rewards may be lower than projected APY due to protocol changes or market conditions</li>
                    <li><strong>Protocol Risk:</strong> Changes to the protocol or economic model may affect staking rewards</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>6.5 Reward Distribution</h3>
                <p>
                    Staking rewards are calculated based on:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The amount of tokens staked</li>
                    <li>The duration of the stake</li>
                    <li>Current APY rate (which may fluctuate)</li>
                    <li>Protocol performance and treasury funds</li>
                    <li>Total tokens staked in the protocol (reward pool dilution)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Rewards may be distributed daily, automatically compounded, or made available at the end of the lock period, depending on the staking tier and protocol settings.
                </p>

                <h3>6.6 Staking Modifications</h3>
                <p>
                    We reserve the right to modify staking terms, including APY rates, lock periods, minimum/maximum stake amounts, and reward mechanisms, at any time to ensure protocol sustainability. Changes may be implemented through DAO governance or by the protocol team in response to market conditions or regulatory requirements.
                </p>

                <h3>6.7 Tax Implications</h3>
                <p>
                    Staking rewards may be subject to taxation in your jurisdiction. You are solely responsible for determining and complying with all applicable tax obligations related to staking activities. We recommend consulting with a tax professional.

                <p>
                    <strong>HYPEAI tokens are utility tokens, not securities or investment contracts.</strong> Tokens do not represent:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Equity ownership or shares in HypeAI or any affiliated entity</li>

                <p>
                    You should not purchase tokens with the expectation of profit or financial return.
                </p>

                <h3>9.3 Token Economics</h3>
                <p>
                    Total Supply: 1,000,000,000 HYPEAI tokens
                </p>
                <p>
                    Transaction fees: 8% (subject to change via governance)

                    <li>2% Treasury</li>
                    <li>1% Token burn (deflationary)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Token distribution, transaction fees, and economic mechanisms may be modified through DAO governance or protocol updates.
                </p>

                <h3>9.4 No Guaranteed Value</h3>
                <p class="warning">
                    <strong>TOKENS HAVE NO GUARANTEED OR INTRINSIC VALUE.</strong> Token price is determined by market forces and may:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fluctuate dramatically and without warning</li>
                    <li>Decrease to zero value</li>
                    <li>Become illiquid with no available buyers</li>
                    <li>Be affected by regulatory actions, technical failures, or market manipulation</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>9.5 Token Sale Terms</h3>
                <p>
                    If you participate in token sales, pre-sales, or initial distributions:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>All sales are final and non-refundable</li>
                    <li>Token delivery timelines are estimates and may be delayed</li>
                    <li>Vesting schedules (if applicable) are enforced by smart contracts and cannot be accelerated</li>
                    <li>You acknowledge full understanding of purchase terms and tokenomics</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>9.6 Smart Contract Risks</h3>
                <p>
                    HYPEAI tokens are managed by smart contracts deployed on blockchain networks. Smart contract risks include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Code vulnerabilities that could be exploited</li>
                    <li>Bugs or errors affecting token functionality</li>
                    <li>Potential for permanent loss of tokens due to contract failures</li>
                    <li>Inability to reverse transactions or recover lost tokens</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    While our smart contracts undergo security audits, no audit can guarantee complete security or absence of vulnerabilities.

                <h3>19.1 Informal Dispute Resolution</h3>
                <p>
                    Before initiating formal legal proceedings, you agree to first attempt to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Platform (collectively, "Disputes") informally by contacting us at legal@hypeai.io. We will attempt to resolve Disputes through good-faith negotiations within 60 days.
                </p>

                <h3>19.2 Binding Arbitration</h3>
                <p class="warning">

                </p>
                <p>
                    If informal resolution is unsuccessful, you agree that all Disputes shall be resolved by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules, rather than in court. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator and shall take place remotely via videoconference or, if the parties agree, in person at a mutually convenient location.
                </p>

                    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Arbitration shall be conducted in English and governed by the laws specified in Section 19.7</li>
                    <li><strong>Costs:</strong> Each party shall bear its own arbitration costs, except that we will pay your arbitration filing fees if your claim is for less than $10,000</li>
                    <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> Discovery shall be limited to expedite the arbitration process and reduce costs</li>
                    <li><strong>Decision:</strong> The arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding, with limited rights to appeal</li>
                    <li><strong>Enforcement:</strong> Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction</li>

                    <strong>YOU AND HYPEAI AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING DISPUTES AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</strong> Arbitrations may not be consolidated without the consent of all parties. The arbitrator may not preside over any class, consolidated, or representative proceeding.
                </p>

                <h3>19.5 Exceptions to Arbitration</h3>
                <p>
                    Either party may seek injunctive or equitable relief in court to protect intellectual property rights or confidential information without first engaging in arbitration.
                </p>

                <h3>19.6 Opt-Out Right</h3>
                <p>

Your notice must include your name, wallet address, and a clear statement that you wish to opt out of the arbitration agreement. If you opt out, all other terms of this agreement remain in effect, but disputes will be resolved in court rather than through arbitration.

                <p>
                    These Terms and any Disputes shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of [JURISDICTION TO BE DETERMINED BASED ON COMPANY INCORPORATION], without regard to its conflict of law provisions. If the arbitration agreement is found to be unenforceable or if you opt out, you agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of courts located in [JURISDICTION TO BE DETERMINED].
