# HypeAI Smart Contract Security Audit Report

**Audit Date:** October 10, 2025
**Auditor:** GUARDIAN - Chief Security Officer & Smart Contract Security Auditor
**Project:** HypeAI Token Ecosystem
**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** DEMO Security Audit for AI Services Platform

---

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive security audit examines the HypeAI token ecosystem, consisting of four primary smart contracts:
- **Token.sol** - Main ERC-20 token with advanced tokenomics
- **Staking.sol** - Multi-tier staking rewards system
- **Governance.sol** - DAO governance with token-weighted voting
- **PrivateSale.sol** - Founding Members private sale contract

### Overall Risk Assessment

| Risk Level | Count | Severity Distribution |
|------------|-------|----------------------|
| CRITICAL   | 5     | Immediate attention required |
| HIGH       | 8     | Should be addressed before mainnet |
| MEDIUM     | 12    | Recommended improvements |
| LOW        | 7     | Best practice enhancements |

### Key Findings Summary

The audit identified **32 total findings** across security, functionality, and best practices categories. While the contracts demonstrate good foundational security practices (use of OpenZeppelin libraries, ReentrancyGuard, access controls), several critical issues require immediate attention:

1. **Token Contract**: Reflection mechanism logic errors, unsafe external calls, centralization risks
2. **Staking Contract**: Reward funding mechanism missing, potential for reward exhaustion
3. **Governance Contract**: Flash loan voting vulnerability, no delegation mechanism
4. **PrivateSale Contract**: Hardcoded price oracle, unsafe external calls, front-running risks

## Detailed Findings

## Contract 1: Token.sol (HypeAI Token)

### CRITICAL FINDINGS

#### [C-1] Reflection Mechanism Not Properly Implemented

**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Location:** Lines 55-60, 312-343
**Impact:** Reflection rewards system is initialized but never properly integrated with transfers

**Description:**
The contract initializes reflection tracking variables but the reflection mechanism is not properly implemented in the `_update` function. Users' reflection balances are never updated during transfers, making the reflection system completely non-functional.

```solidity
// Line 116: Only owner gets reflection balance
_reflectionBalances[owner()] = _reflectionTotal;

// Line 312-315: balanceOf tries to read reflection balances
function balanceOf(address account) public view override returns (uint256) {
    if (isExcludedFromReflections[account]) return super.balanceOf(account);
    return _tokenFromReflection(_reflectionBalances[account]);
}
```

**Issue:** The `_reflectionBalances` mapping is never updated for users during transfers, causing `balanceOf()` to always return 0 for non-excluded addresses.

**Recommendation:**
Either fully implement the reflection mechanism with proper transfer logic updates, or remove the incomplete reflection system entirely to avoid confusion and gas waste.

---

#### [C-2] Dual Balance Tracking Causes Inconsistency

**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Location:** Lines 127-185
**Impact:** Token balances tracked in two systems (ERC-20 standard + reflection) will diverge

**Description:**
The contract attempts to maintain both standard ERC-20 balances (via `super._update()`) and reflection balances (`_reflectionBalances`), but only updates the standard balances. This creates a dangerous inconsistency where:
- Transfers use `super._update()` (standard ERC-20)
- `balanceOf()` reads from `_reflectionBalances` (reflection system)

**Example Attack:**
```solidity
// User receives 1000 tokens via super._update()
// balanceOf(user) returns 0 because _reflectionBalances[user] was never set
// User appears to have 0 balance but actually has 1000 tokens
```

**Recommendation:**
Choose ONE balance tracking system. If keeping reflections, properly implement RFI (Reflect Finance) tokenomics pattern.

---

#### [C-3] No Reward Funding Mechanism for Staking

**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Location:** Token.sol lines 254-307, referenced by Staking.sol
**Impact:** Staking rewards will fail when contract token balance is insufficient

**Description:**
The Token contract implements staking functionality (lines 254-307) that promises APY rewards:
- 12% base APY
- Up to 62% APY for 365-day stakes

However, there is no mechanism to ensure the contract has sufficient tokens to pay these rewards. The contract will fail to pay rewards when its balance is depleted.

**Calculation Example:**
```
User stakes: 10,000,000 HYPEAI for 365 days at 62% APY
Expected reward: 6,200,000 HYPEAI
If contract has < 6,200,000 tokens: unstake() REVERTS
```

**Recommendation:**
1. Implement a treasury reserve specifically for staking rewards
2. Add emergency withdrawal with penalty if rewards insufficient
3. Calculate sustainable APY based on available reserves
4. Consider inflationary token model or fee collection for rewards

---

#### [C-4] Unsafe External Call Pattern

**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Location:** PrivateSale.sol line 328
**Impact:** Potential reentrancy and DoS attacks

**Description:**
```solidity
// Line 328: Unsafe low-level call
(bool success, ) = owner().call{value: bnbBalance}("");
require(success, "BNB transfer failed");
```

While protected by `onlyOwner`, if the owner is a contract, this creates a reentrancy vector. Additionally, it forwards all gas, allowing the recipient to consume excessive gas or revert maliciously.

**Recommendation:**
```solidity
// Use transfer or send with fixed gas
address payable recipient = payable(owner());
recipient.transfer(bnbBalance);

// OR implement withdrawal pattern
mapping(address => uint256) public pendingWithdrawals;
```

---

#### [C-5] Front-Running Vulnerability in Private Sale

**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Location:** PrivateSale.sol lines 99-154
**Impact:** MEV bots can front-run purchases to reach hard cap first

**Description:**
The purchase functions have no protection against front-running. When the sale is close to the hard cap, attackers can:
1. Monitor mempool for purchase transactions
2. Front-run with higher gas price
3. Consume remaining allocation
4. Cause legitimate transactions to revert

**Example:**
```
Hard Cap: $80,000
Current: $79,500
Alice submits: purchaseWithBNB($500)
Bot sees transaction, front-runs with $600 (exceeds cap)
Alice's transaction reverts
```

**Recommendation:**
1. Implement commit-reveal scheme
2. Add purchase queuing system
3. Use batch processing with fair ordering
4. Consider using Flashbots/private mempools

---

### HIGH SEVERITY FINDINGS

#### [H-1] Centralization Risk - Owner Has Excessive Control

**Severity:** HIGH
**Location:** Token.sol lines 346-405
**Impact:** Single point of failure, rug pull potential

**Description:**
The owner has unrestricted control over critical parameters:
- Can set fees up to 15% (line 39: `maxFee = 1500`)
- Can blacklist any address (line 381-383)
- Can exclude addresses from fees/limits (lines 385-390)
- Can change treasury/liquidity wallets (lines 397-405)

**Centralization Risks:**
1. Owner could set 15% fees and extract maximum value
2. Blacklist functionality can freeze user funds
3. No timelock on parameter changes
4. Single address compromise = total control

**Recommendation:**
1. Implement multi-signature wallet for owner role
2. Add timelock for parameter changes (24-48 hours)
3. Set immutable limits on fee changes (max 5%)
4. Remove blacklist or add community governance
5. Make treasury/liquidity wallets immutable or governance-controlled

---

#### [H-2] Hardcoded Price Oracle

**Severity:** HIGH
**Location:** PrivateSale.sol line 108
**Impact:** Incorrect token pricing, financial loss

**Description:**
```solidity
// Line 108: Hardcoded BNB price
uint256 usdValue = (msg.value * 600) / 10**18; // Assumes 1 BNB = $600
```

This creates multiple issues:
1. BNB price fluctuates significantly ($200-$700+ range)
2. Users may overpay or underpay depending on actual BNB price
3. No mechanism to update price
4. Sale economics break if BNB price moves

**Example:**
```
If BNB = $300 (actual) but contract assumes $600:
- User sends 1 BNB expecting $300 worth of tokens
- Contract calculates $600, gives 2x tokens
- Project loses 50% of intended capital
```

**Recommendation:**
```solidity
// Use Chainlink or other oracle
import "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol";

AggregatorV3Interface public priceFeed;

function getBNBPrice() public view returns (uint256) {
    (, int256 price, , ,) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
    return uint256(price) * 10**10; // Convert to 18 decimals
}
```

---

#### [H-3] Reward Calculation Vulnerable to Manipulation

**Severity:** HIGH
**Location:** Staking.sol lines 67-76
**Impact:** Users can claim inflated rewards by timing attacks

**Description:**
```solidity
// Line 72-73: Reward based on time since last claim
uint256 timeStaked = block.timestamp - userStake.lastClaim;
uint256 rewards = (userStake.amount * tier.apy * timeStaked) / (365 days * 10000);
```

**Issues:**
1. Users can wait until last block before unstaking to maximize rewards
2. No maximum reward cap per stake
3. If user never claims, rewards accumulate indefinitely
4. APY compounds linearly, not following standard APY calculations

**Recommendation:**
```solidity
// Cap rewards to actual lock period
uint256 maxTimeStaked = tier.lockPeriod;
uint256 actualTimeStaked = min(block.timestamp - userStake.lastClaim, maxTimeStaked);

// Add reward checkpoints
struct Stake {
    uint256 maxRewards; // Set at stake time
    uint256 claimedRewards;
}
```

---

#### [H-4] Missing Input Validation on Fee Settings

**Severity:** HIGH
**Location:** Token.sol lines 352-365
**Impact:** Owner can accidentally set invalid fee configurations

**Description:**
```solidity
function setFees(
    uint256 _reflectionFee,
    uint256 _liquidityFee,
    uint256 _burnFee,
    uint256 _treasuryFee
) external onlyOwner {
    reflectionFee = _reflectionFee;
    liquidityFee = _liquidityFee;
    burnFee = _burnFee;
    treasuryFee = _treasuryFee;
    totalFees = _reflectionFee + _liquidityFee + _burnFee + _treasuryFee;
    require(totalFees <= maxFee, "Total fees exceed maximum");
}
```

**Issues:**
1. No minimum fee validation (owner can set 0% fees)
2. No validation that individual fees are reasonable
3. No event-driven emergency checks
4. Changes take effect immediately

**Recommendation:**
```solidity
require(_reflectionFee >= 100 && _reflectionFee <= 500, "Invalid reflection fee");
require(_liquidityFee >= 100 && _liquidityFee <= 500, "Invalid liquidity fee");
require(_burnFee <= 300, "Burn fee too high");
require(_treasuryFee <= 500, "Treasury fee too high");
```

---

#### [H-5] Flash Loan Attack on Governance

**Severity:** HIGH
**Location:** Governance.sol lines 104-129
**Impact:** Attacker can manipulate votes with borrowed tokens

**Description:**
```solidity
// Line 112: Vote weight based on current balance
uint256 weight = governanceToken.balanceOf(msg.sender);
```

The governance system checks token balance at vote time, making it vulnerable to flash loan attacks:

**Attack Scenario:**
```
1. Attacker takes flash loan of 10M HYPEAI tokens
2. Creates proposal or votes with 10M voting power
3. Repays flash loan in same transaction
4. Cost: Only flash loan fee (~0.09%)
```

**Recommendation:**
```solidity
// Use snapshot-based voting
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20Snapshot.sol";

// Store snapshot ID per proposal
struct Proposal {
    uint256 snapshotId;
    // ... other fields
}

// Vote with snapshot balance
uint256 weight = governanceToken.balanceOfAt(msg.sender, proposal.snapshotId);
```

---

#### [H-6] No Emergency Stop Mechanism in Token Contract

**Severity:** HIGH
**Location:** Token.sol (entire contract)
**Impact:** Cannot pause trading in case of emergency

**Description:**
While the PrivateSale and Staking contracts inherit `Pausable`, the main Token contract does not. If a critical vulnerability is discovered, there's no way to pause trading to prevent exploitation.

**Recommendation:**
```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/Pausable.sol";

contract HypeAI is ERC20, Ownable, ReentrancyGuard, Pausable {
    function _update(address from, address to, uint256 amount)
        internal
        override
        whenNotPaused
    {
        // ... existing logic
    }

    function pause() external onlyOwner { _pause(); }
    function unpause() external onlyOwner { _unpause(); }
}
```

---

#### [H-7] Stake Array Manipulation Vulnerability

**Severity:** HIGH
**Location:** Token.sol lines 300-301
**Impact:** Deleting stake by swap-and-pop can cause wrong stake removal

**Description:**
```solidity
// Lines 300-301: Dangerous array manipulation
stakes[msg.sender][stakeIndex] = stakes[msg.sender][stakes[msg.sender].length - 1];
stakes[msg.sender].pop();
```

**Issue:**
If a user has multiple stakes and removes one, the indices shift. This can cause:
1. User removes stake 0, but stake 2 moves to position 0
2. User interface shows wrong staking information
3. Users may unstake wrong positions
4. Index-based operations become unreliable

**Example:**
```
User has 3 stakes: [Stake0, Stake1, Stake2]
User unstakes index 0
Result: [Stake2, Stake1] <- Stake2 moved to index 0!
User UI still shows Stake0 at index 0 (now actually Stake2)
```

**Recommendation:**
```solidity
// Use mapping instead of array
mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => Stake)) public stakes;
mapping(address => uint256) public stakeCount;

// Or use soft delete
struct Stake {
    uint256 amount;
    bool active;
    // ... other fields
}

function unstake(uint256 stakeIndex) external {
    stakes[msg.sender][stakeIndex].active = false;
    // Don't remove from array
}
```

---

#### [H-8] Integer Truncation in USDT Conversion

**Severity:** HIGH
**Location:** PrivateSale.sol line 135
**Impact:** Loss of precision in price calculations

**Description:**
```solidity
// Line 135: Dangerous division
uint256 usdValue = _usdtAmount / 10**18;
```

**Issues:**
1. USDT has 18 decimals on BSC, but this truncates to whole dollars
2. User sending $99.99 worth of USDT gets counted as $99
3. Accumulated truncation errors benefit the contract
4. Users lose value on every purchase

**Example:**
```
User sends: 99.99 USDT (99,990,000,000,000,000,000 wei)
usdValue calculated: 99 USD
Loss per transaction: $0.99
Over 100 transactions: $99 lost to truncation
```

**Recommendation:**
```solidity
// Maintain precision, scale at end
uint256 usdValue = _usdtAmount; // Keep 18 decimals

// Adjust token calculations
uint256 baseTokens = (_usdValue * 1250); // Already in correct units
```

---

### MEDIUM SEVERITY FINDINGS

#### [M-1] Unbounded Loop in Reflection Calculation

**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Location:** Token.sol lines 328-343
**Impact:** Gas exhaustion if many addresses excluded from reflections

**Description:**
```solidity
// Line 332: Unbounded loop
for (uint256 i = 0; i < _excludedFromReflections.length; i++) {
    // ... calculations
}
```

If the `_excludedFromReflections` array grows large, this function becomes gas-expensive or impossible to execute. This affects every `balanceOf()` call for reflection-enabled addresses.

**Recommendation:**
```solidity
// Limit excluded addresses
uint256 public constant MAX_EXCLUDED = 50;

function excludeFromReflections(address account) external onlyOwner {
    require(_excludedFromReflections.length < MAX_EXCLUDED, "Too many excluded");
    // ... rest of logic
}
```

---

#### [M-2] No Minimum Lock Period Enforcement

**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Location:** Token.sol lines 254-280
**Impact:** Users can stake with invalid lock periods through direct contract interaction

**Description:**
```solidity
// Lines 257-260: Only checks for specific values
require(
    lockPeriodDays == 30 || lockPeriodDays == 90 || lockPeriodDays == 365,
    "Invalid lock period"
);
```

While this validates input, there's no check that the calculated lock time is reasonable. Edge cases with block.timestamp manipulation or time overflow aren't handled.

**Recommendation:**
```solidity
// Add explicit bounds checking
require(lockPeriodDays >= 30 && lockPeriodDays <= 365, "Lock period out of range");
require(block.timestamp + (lockPeriodDays * 1 days) > block.timestamp, "Overflow check");
```

---

#### [M-3] AI Fee Adjustment Can Be Gamed

**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Location:** Token.sol lines 159-163, 221-238
**Impact:** Whale can manipulate fees through volume manipulation

**Description:**
```solidity
// Lines 222-235: Volume-based fee adjustment
uint256 volumeRatio = (dailyVolume * 10000) / TOTAL_SUPPLY;

if (volumeRatio > 500) {
    totalFees = minFee; // 5% (reduced fees)
}
```

**Attack:**
A whale can manipulate daily volume to trigger lower fees:
1. Create 2 wallets (A and B)
2. Transfer tokens back and forth to inflate volume
3. Each transfer counts toward `dailyVolume`
4. Trigger 5% minimum fee (down from 8% standard)
5. Execute large sell at reduced fees

**Recommendation:**
```solidity
// Only count buy/sell through AMM pairs
if (automatedMarketMakerPairs[from] || automatedMarketMakerPairs[to]) {
    dailyVolume += amount;
}

// Add cooldown per address
mapping(address => uint256) public lastVolumeContribution;
require(block.timestamp > lastVolumeContribution[msg.sender] + 1 hours, "Volume cooldown");
```

---

#### [M-4] Missing Events for Critical State Changes

**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Location:** Multiple locations across all contracts
**Impact:** Difficult to track parameter changes off-chain

**Description:**
Several critical functions don't emit events:
- Token.sol: `setMaxTransactionAmount` (line 367)
- Token.sol: `setMaxWalletAmount` (line 372)
- Token.sol: `setBlacklist` (line 381)
- Staking.sol: No events for tier updates
- PrivateSale.sol: `extendSale` (line 359)

**Recommendation:**
```solidity
event MaxTransactionAmountUpdated(uint256 oldAmount, uint256 newAmount);
event MaxWalletAmountUpdated(uint256 oldAmount, uint256 newAmount);
event BlacklistUpdated(address indexed account, bool status);
event SaleExtended(uint256 oldEndTime, uint256 newEndTime);
```

---

#### [M-5] No Slippage Protection in Private Sale

**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Location:** PrivateSale.sol lines 99-154
**Impact:** Users may get fewer tokens than expected due to race conditions

**Description:**
When multiple users purchase simultaneously, token calculations are done instantly without considering pending transactions. User A may expect 1M tokens but receive fewer if User B's transaction processes first.

**Recommendation:**
```solidity
function purchaseWithBNB(uint256 minTokensExpected) external payable {
    // ... existing logic
    require(totalTokens >= minTokensExpected, "Slippage too high");
    // ... continue
}
```

---

#### [M-6] Governance Proposal Spam Attack

**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Location:** Governance.sol lines 77-97
**Impact:** Malicious actor can spam proposals

**Description:**
While there's a `proposalThreshold` requirement, there's no limit on proposals per address or time-based rate limiting. An attacker with sufficient tokens can create unlimited proposals.

**Recommendation:**
```solidity
mapping(address => uint256) public lastProposalTime;
uint256 public constant PROPOSAL_COOLDOWN = 1 days;

function createProposal(string memory _description) external returns (uint256) {
    require(
        block.timestamp >= lastProposalTime[msg.sender] + PROPOSAL_COOLDOWN,
        "Proposal cooldown active"
    );
    lastProposalTime[msg.sender] = block.timestamp;
    // ... rest of logic
}
```

---

#### [M-7] Reward Rounding Errors in Staking

**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Location:** Staking.sol line 73
**Impact:** Small stakes may receive 0 rewards due to rounding

**Description:**
```solidity
uint256 rewards = (userStake.amount * tier.apy * timeStaked) / (365 days * 10000);
```

For small stake amounts or short time periods, integer division rounds down to zero.

**Example:**
```
Stake: 100 tokens (100 * 10^18 wei)
APY: 17% (1700 basis points)
Time: 1 hour (3600 seconds)

rewards = (100 * 10^18 * 1700 * 3600) / (31536000 * 10000)
        = 612000000000000000000000 / 315360000000
        = 1,940,000,000 wei
        ≈ 0.0000000019 tokens (rounds to 0 in many cases)
```

**Recommendation:**
```solidity
// Use higher precision or different reward distribution model
uint256 public constant PRECISION = 10**27; // Increase precision

// Or set minimum claimable reward
uint256 public constant MIN_REWARD = 10**18; // 1 token minimum
require(rewards >= MIN_REWARD, "Reward too small");
```

---

#### [M-8] No Maximum Supply Cap Enforcement

**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Location:** Token.sol line 26
**Impact:** Reward distribution could theoretically exceed supply

**Description:**
While the contract sets `TOTAL_SUPPLY = 1_000_000_000 * 10**18`, the staking reward mechanism (lines 295-296) doesn't check if rewards would exceed circulating supply:

```solidity
uint256 reward = (userStake.amount * userStake.rewardRate * stakingDuration) / (365 days) / 10000;
uint256 totalAmount = userStake.amount + reward;
```

If rewards are paid from contract balance without proper treasury management, the total circulating supply could exceed the intended cap.

**Recommendation:**
```solidity
uint256 public constant MAX_SUPPLY = 1_000_000_000 * 10**18;
uint256 public circulatingSupply;

function _mint(address account, uint256 amount) internal override {
    require(circulatingSupply + amount <= MAX_SUPPLY, "Exceeds max supply");
    circulatingSupply += amount;
    super._mint(account, amount);
}
```

---

#### [M-9] Proposal Execution Has No Implementation

**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Location:** Governance.sol lines 173-185
**Impact:** Passed proposals cannot actually execute changes

**Description:**
```solidity
function executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId) external {
    // ... validation logic
    proposal.executed = true;
    proposal.status = ProposalStatus.Executed;
    emit ProposalExecuted(_proposalId);
    // NO ACTUAL EXECUTION LOGIC
}
```

The function marks proposals as executed but doesn't implement any execution logic. This makes the entire governance system ineffective.

**Recommendation:**
```solidity
struct Proposal {
    address target;        // Contract to call
    bytes callData;        // Function call data
    uint256 value;         // ETH to send
    // ... existing fields
}

function executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId) external {
    // ... validation
    (bool success, ) = proposal.target.call{value: proposal.value}(proposal.callData);
    require(success, "Execution failed");
    // ... rest of logic
}
```

---

#### [M-10] Staking Contract Has No Owner Functions

**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Location:** Staking.sol (entire contract)
**Impact:** Cannot update staking parameters or handle emergencies

**Description:**
The Staking contract has no admin functions to:
- Update APY rates
- Add new staking tiers
- Pause/unpause staking
- Emergency withdraw stuck tokens
- Update staking token address if needed

**Recommendation:**
```solidity
function updateTierAPY(uint256 _tier, uint256 _newAPY) external onlyOwner {
    require(_tier < 3, "Invalid tier");
    require(_newAPY >= 500 && _newAPY <= 10000, "Invalid APY");
    stakingTiers[_tier].apy = _newAPY;
    emit TierAPYUpdated(_tier, _newAPY);
}

function emergencyWithdraw(address _token, uint256 _amount) external onlyOwner whenPaused {
    IERC20(_token).safeTransfer(owner(), _amount);
}
```

---

#### [M-11] Whitelist Can Be Bypassed

**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Location:** PrivateSale.sol lines 99-154
**Impact:** Non-whitelisted users can participate through contract interaction

**Description:**
Whitelist checks happen at the function level, but users can potentially bypass through:
1. Contract-to-contract calls
2. Proxy contracts
3. Purchasing through intermediary

**Recommendation:**
```solidity
// Add TX origin check (careful with composability)
require(tx.origin == msg.sender, "No contract purchases");

// Or implement more sophisticated whitelisting
mapping(address => bytes32) public whitelistProofs; // Merkle proof based
```

---

#### [M-12] No Deadline Parameter for Time-Sensitive Operations

**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Location:** Token.sol, PrivateSale.sol
**Impact:** Transactions can execute at unfavorable times

**Description:**
Purchase and staking functions don't have deadline parameters. In congested networks, transactions may sit in mempool and execute much later at different prices/conditions.

**Recommendation:**
```solidity
function stake(
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 lockPeriodDays,
    uint256 deadline
) external nonReentrant {
    require(block.timestamp <= deadline, "Transaction expired");
    // ... rest of logic
}
```

---

### LOW SEVERITY FINDINGS

#### [L-1] Magic Numbers Throughout Codebase

**Severity:** LOW
**Location:** Multiple locations
**Impact:** Reduced code readability and maintainability

**Description:**
Numerous magic numbers appear throughout the code:
- Token.sol line 171: `10000` (basis points divisor)
- Token.sol line 222: `500`, `200` (volume thresholds)
- PrivateSale.sol line 108: `600` (BNB price)
- PrivateSale.sol line 169: `1250` (token price multiplier)

**Recommendation:**
```solidity
uint256 private constant BASIS_POINTS = 10000;
uint256 private constant HIGH_VOLUME_THRESHOLD = 500;
uint256 private constant MEDIUM_VOLUME_THRESHOLD = 200;
uint256 private constant TOKENS_PER_USD = 1250;
```

---

#### [L-2] Inconsistent Solidity Versions

**Severity:** LOW
**Location:** Contract pragmas
**Impact:** Potential compilation inconsistencies

**Description:**
- Token.sol: `pragma solidity ^0.8.20;`
- Staking.sol: `pragma solidity ^0.8.19;`
- Governance.sol: `pragma solidity ^0.8.19;`
- PrivateSale.sol: `pragma solidity ^0.8.20;`

**Recommendation:**
```solidity
// Use consistent version across all contracts
pragma solidity 0.8.20; // Fixed version, not floating
```

---

#### [L-3] Missing NatSpec Documentation

**Severity:** LOW
**Location:** Multiple functions across all contracts
**Impact:** Reduced code documentation quality

**Description:**
Many internal and private functions lack NatSpec comments:
- `_handleFeesAndSwaps` (Token.sol line 157)
- `_distributeFees` (Token.sol line 190)
- `_adjustFeesBasedOnVolume` (Token.sol line 221)
- `_processPurchase` (PrivateSale.sol line 162)

**Recommendation:**
Add comprehensive NatSpec comments to all functions.

---

#### [L-4] Unused Return Values

**Severity:** LOW
**Location:** PrivateSale.sol lines 149, 194, 310, 334
**Impact:** Code clarity and error handling

**Description:**
```solidity
// Line 149: Return value not checked
require(
    usdtToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _usdtAmount),
    "USDT transfer failed"
);
```

While `require` checks the result, using `SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom` is more robust and consistent with Staking.sol.

**Recommendation:**
```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol";
using SafeERC20 for IERC20;

usdtToken.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _usdtAmount);
```

---

#### [L-5] No Check for Zero Address in Constructor

**Severity:** LOW
**Location:** PrivateSale.sol line 64
**Impact:** Invalid deployment if owner address is zero

**Description:**
The constructor validates token addresses but not the owner (msg.sender via Ownable). If deployed with CREATE2 to a predictable address or through a factory, this could cause issues.

**Recommendation:**
```solidity
constructor(...) {
    require(msg.sender != address(0), "Invalid owner");
    // ... rest of logic
}
```

---

#### [L-6] Gas Inefficiency in Loops

**Severity:** LOW
**Location:** PrivateSale.sol lines 79-83, 90-93
**Impact:** Higher gas costs for batch operations

**Description:**
```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < _addresses.length; i++) {
    whitelist[_addresses[i]] = true;
    emit WhitelistUpdated(_addresses[i], true);
}
```

Could be optimized by caching array length and using unchecked increment.

**Recommendation:**
```solidity
uint256 length = _addresses.length;
for (uint256 i = 0; i < length;) {
    whitelist[_addresses[i]] = true;
    emit WhitelistUpdated(_addresses[i], true);
    unchecked { ++i; }
}
```

---

#### [L-7] No Validation on Governance Parameters

**Severity:** LOW
**Location:** Governance.sol lines 266-278
**Impact:** Owner could set unreasonable governance parameters

**Description:**
```solidity
function updateParameters(
    uint256 _proposalThreshold,
    uint256 _votingPeriod,
    uint256 _quorumPercentage
) external onlyOwner {
    require(_quorumPercentage <= 10000, "Quorum too high");
    // No other validation
}
```

**Recommendation:**
```solidity
require(_proposalThreshold >= 1000 * 10**18, "Threshold too low");
require(_proposalThreshold <= totalSupply() / 10, "Threshold too high");
require(_votingPeriod >= 1 days, "Voting period too short");
require(_votingPeriod <= 30 days, "Voting period too long");
require(_quorumPercentage >= 100, "Quorum too low"); // At least 1%
```

---

## Gas Optimization Recommendations

### 1. Storage Optimization

**Current Issue:** Multiple storage variables accessed in hot paths
**Optimization:** Pack related variables into single storage slots

```solidity
// Instead of:
uint256 public reflectionFee = 200;    // Slot 1
uint256 public liquidityFee = 300;     // Slot 2
uint256 public burnFee = 100;          // Slot 3
uint256 public treasuryFee = 200;      // Slot 4

// Use:
struct Fees {
    uint64 reflection;  // 200
    uint64 liquidity;   // 300
    uint64 burn;        // 100
    uint64 treasury;    // 200
}
Fees public fees; // Single slot
```

**Estimated Savings:** ~20,000 gas per transfer

---

### 2. Event Parameter Optimization

**Current Issue:** Emitting full structs in events
**Optimization:** Only emit indexed identifiers, store details off-chain

```solidity
// Instead of:
emit TokensPurchased(buyer, usdAmount, baseTokens, bonusTokens, isBNB);

// Use:
emit TokensPurchased(indexed buyer, indexed purchaseId);
// Store details off-chain via subgraph
```

---

### 3. Batch Operations

**Current Issue:** Individual whitelist updates
**Optimization:** Implement bitmap-based whitelist

```solidity
// Instead of mapping(address => bool)
mapping(uint256 => uint256) public whitelistBitmap;

function isWhitelisted(address user) public view returns (bool) {
    uint256 bucket = uint256(uint160(user)) / 256;
    uint256 position = uint256(uint160(user)) % 256;
    return (whitelistBitmap[bucket] >> position) & 1 == 1;
}
```

**Estimated Savings:** ~5,000 gas per whitelist operation

---

## Best Practice Recommendations

### 1. Implement Comprehensive Testing

**Required Test Coverage:**
- Unit tests for each function (target: 100% coverage)
- Integration tests for contract interactions
- Fuzz testing for edge cases
- Gas profiling tests
- Upgradeability tests if using proxies

**Critical Test Scenarios:**
```javascript
// Token.sol tests
- Test staking with all lock periods
- Test fee collection and distribution
- Test reflection mechanism (once fixed)
- Test anti-whale limits
- Test blacklist functionality
- Test emergency scenarios

// Staking.sol tests
- Test reward calculations
- Test early unstake attempts
- Test reward overflow scenarios
- Test multiple simultaneous stakes

// Governance.sol tests
- Test proposal lifecycle
- Test vote manipulation attempts
- Test quorum calculations
- Test proposal execution

// PrivateSale.sol tests
- Test both payment methods
- Test hard cap enforcement
- Test whitelist functionality
- Test founding member limits
```

---

### 2. Implement Monitoring & Alerts

**On-Chain Monitoring:**
- Large transactions (>1% of supply)
- Unusual fee changes
- Blacklist additions
- Governance parameter changes
- Staking reward claims
- Private sale progress

**Recommended Tools:**
- OpenZeppelin Defender for monitoring
- Tenderly for transaction simulation
- Forta for threat detection

---

### 3. Deploy Procedure Recommendations

**Pre-Deployment Checklist:**
1. Complete external audit by reputable firm
2. Bug bounty program (recommend Immunefi)
3. Testnet deployment and testing (BSC Testnet)
4. Mainnet deployment with timelock
5. Gradual feature activation
6. Community multisig for ownership

**Post-Deployment:**
1. Transfer ownership to multisig (3-of-5 or higher)
2. Implement 48-hour timelock on parameter changes
3. Enable monitoring and alerting
4. Establish incident response plan
5. Regular security reviews (quarterly)

---

### 4. Documentation Improvements

**Required Documentation:**
- Comprehensive whitepaper explaining tokenomics
- Technical documentation for all contracts
- API documentation for integrators
- Emergency procedure documentation
- Audit response documentation

---

## Economic Security Analysis

### Token Supply & Distribution

**Total Supply:** 1,000,000,000 HYPEAI

**Potential Issues:**
1. No defined distribution model in contracts
2. Owner receives entire supply at deployment
3. Staking rewards not allocated from supply
4. Burn mechanism reduces supply without adjustment

**Recommendations:**
```solidity
// Define clear allocation
uint256 public constant PRIVATE_SALE_ALLOCATION = 100_000_000 * 10**18;  // 10%
uint256 public constant STAKING_REWARDS_POOL = 200_000_000 * 10**18;     // 20%
uint256 public constant LIQUIDITY_POOL = 150_000_000 * 10**18;           // 15%
uint256 public constant TEAM_ALLOCATION = 100_000_000 * 10**18;          // 10%
uint256 public constant TREASURY = 450_000_000 * 10**18;                 // 45%
```

---

### Private Sale Economics

**Current Model:**
- Price: $0.0008 per token
- Min: $40 (50,000 tokens)
- Max: $800 (1,000,000 tokens)
- Hard Cap: $80,000 (100M tokens)
- 10% bonus: Effective price = $0.000727

**Issues:**
1. Hardcoded BNB price makes economics unpredictable
2. 10% bonus reduces effective capital raised
3. No vesting for founding members
4. Max allocation ($800) may not attract large investors

**Recommendations:**
1. Implement vesting schedule (3-12 months)
2. Use oracle for accurate pricing
3. Consider tiered pricing (early bird discount)
4. Add cliff period before unlocking

---

### Staking Rewards Sustainability

**Current APY Structure:**
- 30 days: 17% APY
- 90 days: 27% APY
- 365 days: 62% APY

**Sustainability Analysis:**
```
Assume 30% of supply staked (300M tokens)
Average APY: 35%
Annual reward requirement: 105M tokens

Current allocation for rewards: UNDEFINED
Risk: Rewards will exhaust available supply
```

**Recommendations:**
1. Define reward pool: 200M tokens (20% of supply)
2. Implement dynamic APY based on pool balance
3. Add reward decay over time
4. Emergency rate adjustment mechanism

```solidity
function calculateDynamicAPY(uint256 tierBaseAPY) internal view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 remainingRewards = rewardPool;
    uint256 totalStaked = getTotalStaked();

    if (remainingRewards < totalStaked / 10) {
        return tierBaseAPY / 2; // Halve APY if rewards low
    }
    return tierBaseAPY;
}
```

---

## Compliance & Legal Considerations

### Regulatory Concerns

**Securities Law:** Token features may classify as security:
- Staking rewards resemble investment returns
- Governance rights
- Profit expectations from team efforts

**Recommendation:** Consult legal counsel for jurisdiction-specific compliance.

### KYC/AML Considerations

**Current State:** No KYC/AML mechanisms in contracts

**Recommendations:**
1. Implement off-chain KYC for private sale
2. Add compliance officer role
3. Consider implementing on-chain KYC verification
4. Geographic restrictions via whitelist

---

## Centralization Risks Summary

### Critical Centralization Points

1. **Owner Controls:**
   - Fee adjustment (0-15%)
   - Blacklist any address
   - Pause trading
   - Change treasury wallets
   - Governance parameter changes

2. **Single Points of Failure:**
   - Owner address compromise
   - No timelock on changes
   - No multi-sig requirement
   - No governance override

3. **Trust Assumptions:**
   - Owner will act in good faith
   - Owner won't rug pull
   - Owner will keep private keys secure

### Decentralization Roadmap

**Phase 1 (Immediate):**
- Transfer ownership to 3-of-5 multisig
- Implement 24-hour timelock

**Phase 2 (3 months):**
- Increase to 5-of-9 multisig
- Implement 48-hour timelock
- Community veto mechanism

**Phase 3 (12 months):**
- Full governance takeover
- Remove or lock critical parameters
- Progressive decentralization
