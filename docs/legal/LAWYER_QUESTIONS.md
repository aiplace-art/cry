# Critical Questions for Estonian Lawyer - HypeAI Private Sale

## Meeting Purpose

To obtain legal guidance on structuring HypeAI Private Sale in compliance with Estonian and EU regulations, ensuring utility token classification (NOT security), and minimizing regulatory risk.

**Background:** HypeAI OÜ (Estonian company) plans to conduct Private Sale of HYPEAI tokens (or Service Credits) before public launch. Token provides access to AI platform services (utility token).

---

## PRIORITY QUESTIONS (Top 15 - If Time Limited)

### 1. Legal Classification

**Q1:** Based on HYPEAI's characteristics (service payment, burn mechanism, DAO governance, no profit promises), do you confirm this is a **utility token** under EU MiCA Regulation, NOT a **security** under Estonian Securities Market Act or MiFID II?

**Why Critical:** Core question determining entire regulatory framework.

---

### 2. Private Sale Structure

**Q2:** Which Private Sale structure do you recommend for lowest legal risk:
- **Option A:** Direct token sale (sell HYPEAI tokens immediately)
- **Option B:** SAFT-like structure (right to receive tokens at TGE)
- **Option C:** Service Credit model (pre-purchase services, convertible to tokens)

**Why Critical:** Structure determines securities risk, licensing requirements, and marketing flexibility.

**Q3:** If we use **Service Credit Model** (pre-purchase services, convertible to tokens later), does this:
- Avoid security classification more clearly than direct token sale?
- Reduce or eliminate need for Virtual Currency License?
- Allow more flexible marketing (can we call it "service discount" vs "investment")?

**Why Critical:** Service Credit Model is our recommended approach - need confirmation it works under Estonian law.

---

### 3. Estonian Licensing

**Q4:** Do we need an **Estonian Virtual Currency Activity License** BEFORE conducting Private Sale?
- If YES: Which type? (Exchange service? Wallet service? Both?)
- If NO: At what point does license become required? (Public listing? TGE?)

**Why Critical:** License application takes 1-3 months and costs €2,000. Need to know timing.

**Q5:** Do we need **FIU (Financial Intelligence Unit) registration** separately from license?
- If YES: What's the process and timeline?
- Can we start Private Sale before registration is complete?

**Why Critical:** Determines launch timeline.

---

### 4. MiCA Compliance

**Q6:** Under EU MiCA Regulation, is **white paper required** for our Private Sale?
- If raising <€1M and <150 participants: Are we exempt?
- If YES to exemption: Do you still recommend voluntary white paper?

**Why Critical:** White paper is significant effort (50+ pages, legal review). Need to know if mandatory or optional.

**Q7:** What specific **MiCA disclosures** are mandatory in our Private Sale documentation (Terms, White Paper)?
- Risk warnings?
- Issuer information?
- Token rights and limitations?
- Technology description?

**Why Critical:** Ensures MiCA compliance from day one.

---

### 5. KYC/AML Requirements

**Q8:** What is the **minimum KYC level** required for Private Sale participants under Estonian AML law?
- Identity verification (passport/ID)?
- Proof of address?
- Source of funds declaration?
- Enhanced Due Diligence threshold (€10,000? €15,000?)

**Why Critical:** KYC provider costs €2-€5 per verification. Need to know exact requirements to budget and implement.

**Q9:** Can we accept participants from:
- **Other EU countries?** (YES presumed, but confirm)
- **Non-EU countries?** (UK, Switzerland, Canada, Australia?)
- **FATF grey-list countries?** (Nigeria, Pakistan, UAE, etc.)
- **US residents?** (We plan to exclude - do you agree this is safest?)

**Why Critical:** Geographic restrictions affect market size and compliance complexity.

---

### 6. Consumer Protection and Refunds

**Q10:** Under **EU Consumer Rights Directive** (14-day cooling-off period):
- Does this apply to our Private Sale? (Digital content exception?)
- If we obtain waiver (customer consents to immediate delivery), is it enforceable?
- Are we required to offer refunds in any scenario? (Platform failure? TGE cancellation?)

**Why Critical:** Refund obligations affect financial planning and Terms & Conditions language.

---

### 7. Marketing and Disclosures

**Q11:** Can we legally say:
- ✅ "Pre-purchase services at 50% discount" (Is this compliant framing?)
- ✅ "Early adopter bonus - 1,000 tokens for $500 (future value: $1,000 if token reaches $1)" (Conditional value statement OK?)
- ❌ "Investment opportunity with expected returns" (Illegal, agreed?)

**Why Critical:** Marketing language determines securities classification. Need clear guidance on what's permissible.

**Q12:** What **risk disclosures** are legally mandatory on our website, Terms, and marketing materials?
- Must warnings be on every page? (Or just purchase page?)
- Specific language required? (E.g., "You may lose all funds")
- Font size or prominence requirements?

**Why Critical:** Ensures consumer protection compliance and reduces litigation risk.

---

### 8. Tax Treatment

**Q13:** How are HYPEAI tokens taxed in Estonia:
- **At purchase:** Is Service Credit purchase subject to VAT? (20% Estonian VAT or exempt?)
- **At TGE/conversion:** Is conversion from Credits → Tokens a taxable event? (Income tax? Capital gains?)
- **At sale:** If participant later sells tokens, is that capital gains tax?
- **For HypeAI OÜ:** Is Private Sale revenue taxable as income? (When? Upon sale or upon TGE?)

**Why Critical:** Tax treatment affects pricing, cash flow, and participant expectations.

---

### 9. What Happens if Regulator Disagrees?

**Q14:** If Estonian FIU or Financial Supervisory Authority later classifies HYPEAI as **security** (despite our best efforts to structure as utility):
- What are remediation options? (Refund? Prospectus? Grandfather clause?)
- Can we "cure" by converting to security-compliant offering?
- What penalties are we exposed to? (Fines? Criminal liability?)

**Why Critical:** Need worst-case scenario planning.

**Q15:** Have you seen Estonian or EU regulators challenge utility token offerings similar to ours?
- Any precedents? (Cases where utility token was deemed security?)
- What were the factors that triggered reclassification?
- How can we avoid those pitfalls?

**Why Critical:** Learn from others' mistakes.

---

## SECONDARY QUESTIONS (If Time Permits)

### 10. Token Generation Event (TGE)

**Q16:** When HYPEAI tokens are created (minted) and distributed:
- Is this a taxable event for participants? (Income tax at FMV?)
- Do we need additional disclosures at TGE?
- Can we delay TGE indefinitely, or must it occur within certain timeframe after Private Sale?

**Q17:** If we implement **vesting schedule** (e.g., 25% at TGE, 75% over 12 months):
- Does this affect tax treatment? (Taxed at receipt or vesting?)
- Does vesting reduce securities risk? (Locks tokens, reduces speculation)

---

### 11. DAO Governance Structure

**Q18:** For our **DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)**:
- Does DAO need separate legal entity? (Estonian MTÜ - non-profit? Or no entity?)
- How do we structure DAO governance to clearly separate from HypeAI OÜ corporate governance?
- Can token holders vote on platform decisions without making HYPEAI a security?

**Q19:** What **cannot** be governed by DAO without triggering security classification?
- Platform pricing (OK?)
- Feature priorities (OK?)
- HypeAI OÜ CEO appointment (NOT OK - correct?)
- Dividend distribution (N/A - but confirm never OK)

---

### 12. Smart Contracts and Audits

**Q20:** Are there Estonian legal requirements for:
- **Smart contract security audits?** (Mandatory or recommended?)
- **Bug bounty programs?** (Required?)
- **Audit report publication?** (Must we disclose audit findings?)

**Q21:** If smart contract has bug resulting in loss of user tokens:
- Is HypeAI OÜ liable? (Consumer protection law? Negligence?)
- Do we need insurance? (Crypto insurance providers?)
- What disclaimers protect us? (E.g., "Smart contracts are experimental")

---

### 13. Exchange Listings

**Q22:** When we later list HYPEAI on crypto exchanges (Uniswap, centralized exchanges):
- Do we need additional Estonian approvals or licenses?
- Does listing change regulatory classification? (From utility to something else?)
- What documentation will exchanges require? (Legal opinion? Compliance certifications?)

---

### 14. Multi-Jurisdictional Issues

**Q23:** If we later expand to accept customers from additional countries:
- At what point do we trigger other countries' securities laws? (If >10% users from Country X?)
- Should we proactively register in major markets? (EU passport covers all EU - but what about UK, Canada?)

**Q24:** **US Market Specifically:**
- We plan to exclude all US participants. Is this sufficient to avoid SEC jurisdiction?
- What if US citizens use VPN to bypass restrictions? (Are we liable? Or user's responsibility?)
- If in future we want to allow US participants, what's required? (Reg D? Reg A+? Reg S offshore?)

---

### 15. Corporate Structure and Ownership

**Q25:** Does token issuance affect **HypeAI OÜ equity structure?**
- Do token holders have any claim on company? (NO - but confirm)
- If company is liquidated, do token holders get anything? (NO - but confirm)
- Can we clearly separate "equity investors" from "token holders"? (Different cap table, different rights?)

**Q26:** Should HypeAI OÜ hold **treasury of HYPEAI tokens?**
- If YES: What % of supply should company hold? (10%? 20%? For liquidity, partnerships, etc.)
- Tax treatment of treasury tokens? (Taxed when minted? When sold?)
- Can company sell treasury tokens later without triggering securities offering?

---

### 16. Data Protection (GDPR)

**Q27:** Our KYC process collects personal data (ID, address, selfie):
- **Data retention:** How long must we keep KYC data? (5 years for AML - but can we delete earlier per GDPR right to erasure?)
- **Cross-border transfers:** If we use non-EU KYC provider (e.g., US-based), is that GDPR-compliant? (Standard contractual clauses?)
- **Data breach:** If KYC data is hacked, what are notification requirements? (72 hours to Data Protection Authority?)

---

### 17. Prohibited Activities and Sanctions

**Q28:** We will screen participants against **EU/UN/OFAC sanctions lists**:
- Is this legally sufficient? (Or must we screen against additional lists?)
- If we accidentally sell to sanctioned person (passed screening but later identified), what's our liability?
- Must we freeze funds and report to FIU? (Process for handling sanctions violations?)

**Q29:** Are there activities we must prohibit in Terms of Service to comply with Estonian law?
- Money laundering (obviously)
- Financing terrorism
- Gambling or betting with tokens?
- Resale of Service Credits before conversion? (Should we prohibit secondary market?)

---

### 18. Intellectual Property

**Q30:** **HYPEAI trademark and branding:**
- Should we register trademark in Estonia? (Or EU-wide?)
- Does token name need trademark protection? (Against copycats?)
- Can we enforce trademark against unauthorized token sales? (E.g., someone else creates fake "HypeAI" token)

---

### 19. Dispute Resolution

**Q31:** In Private Sale Terms, we plan **arbitration clause** (Estonian Chamber of Commerce arbitration):
- Is arbitration enforceable for EU consumers? (Or do they retain right to sue in their home country?)
- Can we require arbitration in English? (Or must offer Estonian language option?)
- What disputes CANNOT be arbitrated? (E.g., criminal matters, regulatory enforcement)

---

### 20. Ongoing Compliance

**Q32:** After Private Sale, what **ongoing obligations** do we have?
- Annual reports to FIU?
- Periodic risk assessments?
- Suspicious Activity Reports (SAR) - when required?
- How long do obligations continue? (Until token delisted? Forever?)

**Q33:** Should we hire **dedicated Compliance Officer** (full-time or part-time)?
- Is this legally required for Virtual Currency License?
- Qualifications needed? (Law degree? CAMS certification?)

---
