## 💰 Fee Structure

### Transaction Fees (Total: 8%)

All transactions are subject to an 8% fee, distributed as follows:

| Fee Type | Percentage | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| **Reflection** | 2% | Redistributed to all holders proportionally |
| **Liquidity** | 3% | Auto-added to liquidity pool |
| **Burn** | 1% | Sent to dead wallet (deflationary) |
| **Treasury** | 2% | Development and marketing fund |

### AI-Driven Dynamic Fees

The smart contract includes AI-powered fee adjustment based on trading volume:

- **High Volume (>5% daily)**: Fees reduced to 5% minimum
- **Medium Volume (2-5% daily)**: Standard 8% fees
- **Low Volume (<2% daily)**: Fees increased to 15% maximum

**Purpose**: Incentivize holding during low volume, encourage trading during consolidation

## 🔥 Burn Mechanism

### Deflationary Model

- **Burn Rate**: 1% per transaction
- **Maximum Burn**: 50% of total supply (500M HYPE)
- **Burn Destination**: 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD

### Burn Projection (1 Year)

Assuming 10M HYPE daily trading volume:

| Month | Burned HYPE | Total Burned | Remaining Supply | Burn % |
|-------|-------------|--------------|------------------|--------|
| 1 | 3,000,000 | 3,000,000 | 997,000,000 | 0.30% |
| 3 | 9,000,000 | 12,000,000 | 988,000,000 | 1.20% |
| 6 | 18,000,000 | 30,000,000 | 970,000,000 | 3.00% |
| 12 | 36,000,000 | 66,000,000 | 934,000,000 | 6.60% |

**Estimated time to 50% burn**: ~7.5 years at current volume

## 🏆 Staking System

### Staking Tiers & APY

| Lock Period | Base APY | Bonus APY | Total APY |
|-------------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| **30 Days** | 12% | +5% | **17%** |
| **90 Days** | 12% | +15% | **27%** |
| **365 Days** | 12% | +50% | **62%** |

### Staking Rewards Example

**Stake: 100,000 HYPE**

#### 30-Day Stake (17% APY)
- Daily Reward: ~46.58 HYPE
- Total Reward (30 days): ~1,397 HYPE
- Compounded Final Amount: ~101,415 HYPE

#### 90-Day Stake (27% APY)
- Daily Reward: ~73.97 HYPE
- Total Reward (90 days): ~6,657 HYPE
- Compounded Final Amount: ~106,881 HYPE

#### 365-Day Stake (62% APY)
- Daily Reward: ~169.86 HYPE
- Total Reward (365 days): ~62,000 HYPE
- Compounded Final Amount: ~185,821 HYPE

### Staking Mechanics

1. **Lock Tokens**: Transfer tokens to staking contract
2. **Earn Rewards**: Daily compounding interest
3. **Unlock Period**: Cannot withdraw before lock period ends
4. **Claim Rewards**: Automatically distributed upon unstaking
5. **Re-stake**: Option to automatically re-stake with higher tier

## 💧 Liquidity Incentives

### LP Reward Program

Liquidity providers earn rewards through:

1. **Trading Fees**: 0.3% of all trades (standard DEX fees)
2. **LP Staking Rewards**: Additional 50% APR in HYPE tokens
3. **Reflection Rewards**: Proportional share of 2% reflection fee

### LP Rewards Example

**Scenario**: 10,000 LP tokens, Pool TVL $1,000,000, Total LP Supply 100,000

- **Pool Share**: 10%
- **Liquidity Value**: $100,000
- **Daily Rewards** (50% APR): $136.99
- **Monthly Rewards**: $4,109.59
- **Yearly Rewards**: $50,000

## 🎁 Reflection Rewards

### Passive Income for Holders

All HYPE holders automatically receive a share of the 2% reflection fee from every transaction.

### Reflection Distribution Example

**Scenario**: You hold 1,000,000 HYPE (0.1% of supply)
**Daily Trading Volume**: 50,000,000 HYPE
**Daily Reflection Pool**: 1,000,000 HYPE (2% of volume)

**Your Daily Reflection**: 1,000 HYPE (0.1% of pool)
**Monthly Reflection**: ~30,000 HYPE
**Yearly Reflection**: ~365,000 HYPE (36.5% passive yield)

## 🛡️ Anti-Whale Mechanisms

### Transaction Limits

| Limit Type | Amount | Percentage |
|------------|--------|------------|
| **Max Transaction** | 5,000,000 HYPE | 0.5% of supply |
| **Max Wallet** | 20,000,000 HYPE | 2% of supply |

### Anti-Whale Features

1. **Progressive Taxation**: Larger transactions pay slightly higher fees
2. **Cooldown Period**: 60-second cooldown between sells
3. **Graduated Selling**: Encourages smaller, distributed sells
4. **Whale Watch**: Community alerts for large transactions

## 🤖 AI-Driven Features

### Dynamic Fee Optimization

The contract uses on-chain volume analysis to adjust fees:

```javascript
Volume > 5% of supply → Reduce fees to 5%
Volume 2-5% of supply → Maintain 8% fees
Volume < 2% of supply → Increase fees to 15%
```

### Predictive Liquidity Management

- Automatically adjusts liquidity additions based on price volatility
- Optimizes swap timing for minimal price impact
- Balances reflection vs. liquidity allocation

### Smart Burn Algorithm

- Analyzes circulating supply and holder distribution
- Adjusts burn rate to maintain optimal deflationary pressure
- Prevents over-burning that could harm liquidity

## 📈 Price Projection Model

### Growth Assumptions

- **Initial Price**: $0.001
- **Target Market Cap**: $100M
- **Target Price**: $0.10 (100x from launch)
- **Growth Rate**: 2% daily average (with volatility)

### 12-Month Price Projection

| Month | Price | Market Cap | Change |
|-------|-------|------------|--------|
| 1 | $0.0016 | $1.6M | +60% |
