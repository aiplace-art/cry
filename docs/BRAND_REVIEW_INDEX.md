## üí° Key Insights

### The Problem
We were writing like every other crypto project - promises, hype, emotion. This makes us look like a scam, even though we're legit.

### The Solution
Write with radical honesty - data, proof, risks. This makes us unique and builds REAL trust.

### The Opportunity
Be the ONLY honest crypto project. In a sea of scams, honesty = competitive advantage.

### The Principle
"–ù–µ –Ω–∞–¥–µ–∂–¥–∞. –ú–∞—Ç–µ–º–∞—Ç–∏–∫–∞." (Not hope. Math.)
