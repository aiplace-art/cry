# CRITICAL FIXES REQUIRED - DO NOT DEPLOY

## SECURITY STATUS: ‚ùå NOT READY FOR MAINNET

**Overall Security Score: 6.5/10**

---

## üö® MUST FIX IMMEDIATELY (Priority 1)

### 1. OWNER CAN RUG PULL WITH 15% FEES
**File:** Token.sol (Line 352-365)
**Risk:** Owner can set fees to 15%, draining user value
**Fix:** Cap fees at 8% maximum, add 1% minimum

### 2. AI FEES ENABLE ECONOMIC ATTACKS
**File:** Token.sol (Line 221-238)
**Risk:** Flash loans + whale coordination can manipulate fees (5%-15%)
**Fix:** REMOVE AI FEES or cap variance to 6%-10% maximum

### 3. STAKING REWARDS WILL FAIL
**File:** Token.sol (Line 254-307)
**Risk:** No reward pool funding, contract will become insolvent
**Fix:** Add reward pool tracking and funding mechanism

### 4. NO VESTING - INSTANT DUMP RISK
**File:** PrivateSale.sol (Line 193-197)
**Risk:** Private sale buyers can dump 100M tokens immediately
**Fix:** Implement 6-month linear vesting schedule

### 5. HARDCODED BNB PRICE ($600)
**File:** PrivateSale.sol (Line 109, 166)
**Risk:** If BNB price changes, users overpay or underpay
**Fix:** Integrate Chainlink oracle for real-time pricing

### 6. REFERRAL REWARDS CAN DRAIN CONTRACT
**File:** ReferralSystem.sol (Line 296-347)
**Risk:** No reserve tracking, contract may not have funds to pay
**Fix:** Add reward reserve tracking system

### 7. UNBOUNDED ARRAY = DOS ATTACK
**File:** Token.sol (Line 332-343)
**Risk:** If exclusion list grows large, gas costs break contract
**Fix:** Add MAX_EXCLUDED_ADDRESSES = 50 limit

## üõ°Ô∏è AI FEES VERDICT: REMOVE

**Current System:**
- Dynamic fees: 5% - 15% based on volume
- 10% variance enables manipulation
- Flash loan attacks possible
- Whale coordination exploits

**Recommendation:**
- Remove AI fees for launch
- Use fixed 8% fee structure
- Can add AI features later after proven security
