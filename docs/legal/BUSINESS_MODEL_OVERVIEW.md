**Visual 1-Pager for Lawyer Consultation**

---

## üéØ WHAT IS HYPEAI?

### One-Line Description
**AI-powered DeFi platform combining 15 specialized AI agents with blockchain technology to create intelligent financial tools**

### Platform Type
**Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) + Blockchain Infrastructure**

- NOT a cryptocurrency exchange
- NOT offering securities
- IS a technology platform with token utility
- IS a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)

---

## üí∞ REVENUE STREAMS

### 1. Platform Transaction Fees (8% total)

**Distribution of 8% fee:**
```
User Transaction (100 HYPEAI)
    ‚Üì
‚îú‚îÄ 2% ‚Üí Reflection Rewards (to all holders)
‚îú‚îÄ 3% ‚Üí Liquidity Pool (automatic)
‚îú‚îÄ 1% ‚Üí Burn (deflationary)
‚îî‚îÄ 2% ‚Üí Treasury (platform operations)
```

**Key Points:**
- Automatic distribution via smart contracts
- NOT trading fees (technology usage fees)
- Self-sustaining tokenomics
- Transparent on-chain

**Annual Projection:**
- Year 1: $500K - $1M
- Year 2: $2M - $5M
- Year 3: $10M - $25M

---

### 2. Staking Platform Fees

**Three-tier staking system:**

| Lock Period | APY | Fee Model |
|------------|-----|-----------|
| 30 days | 17% | Platform keeps 15% of rewards |
| 90 days | 27% | Platform keeps 12% of rewards |
| 365 days | 62% | Platform keeps 10% of rewards |

**How it works:**
- Users lock tokens in smart contract
- AI models optimize reward distribution
- Platform takes small percentage
- Users earn passive income

**Projected TVL (Total Value Locked):**
- Month 3: $5M - $10M
- Month 6: $20M - $50M
- Year 1: $100M - $200M

---

- Year 2: $500K - $1.5M
- Year 3: $2M - $5M

---

- Year 2: 20,000 Pro + 200 Enterprise ($1.2M MRR)

---

## ü™ô TOKEN ECONOMICS

### HYPEAI Token Utility (NOT investment instrument)

**Use Cases:**
1. **Governance** - Vote on platform decisions (DAO)
2. **Staking** - Lock tokens for rewards
3. **Fee Payment** - Pay for AI services
4. **Access Rights** - Premium features
5. **Incentives** - Community rewards

**Total Supply:** 1,000,000,000 HYPEAI

**Distribution:**
```
40% (400M) ‚Üí Public Sale / Liquidity
20% (200M) ‚Üí Staking Rewards Pool (5-year distribution)
15% (150M) ‚Üí Team (2-year vesting, 6-month cliff)
10% (100M) ‚Üí Treasury / DAO (3-year vesting)
8%  (80M)  ‚Üí Marketing & Partnerships (2-year vesting)
5%  (50M)  ‚Üí Advisors (1-year vesting, 3-month cliff)
2%  (20M)  ‚Üí Airdrop / Community (immediate)
```

**Vesting prevents:**
- Team dumping
- Investor dumping
- Sustainable tokenomics

---

### Deflationary Mechanisms

**Token Burn:**
- 1% of every transaction
- 50% of AI service fees
- Target: 50% total supply burned over 10 years

**Effect:**

- Potentially increasing scarcity
- Deflationary pressure

**Burn Projection:**
- Year 1: 50M tokens (5%)
- Year 3: 200M tokens (20%)
- Year 10: 500M tokens (50%)
