# HypeAI Private Sale - Legal Structure & Options

## Executive Summary

This document presents three compliant legal structures for the HypeAI Private Sale, with analysis of risks, benefits, and regulatory implications under EU/Estonian law.

**Recommended Structure:** **Service Credit Model (Option C)** - Lowest legal risk, clearest utility argument.

---

## 1. Legal Framework Context

### Regulatory Environment

**EU Level:**
- **MiCA Regulation (EU) 2023/1114** - Crypto-asset markets framework
- **5th & 6th AML Directives** - Anti-money laundering requirements
- **GDPR** - Data protection for KYC information

**Estonian Level:**
- **Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Prevention Act (MLTFPA)**
- **Virtual Currency Act** - License requirements
- **Estonian Securities Market Act** - If token = security

### Key Legal Question

**Is HYPEAI token a security or utility token?**

**Answer:** Utility token (service access), NOT security (investment)

**How to ensure this classification:**
1. Emphasize consumptive utility (tokens used, not held for profit)
2. Avoid investment marketing language
3. Platform functional at token sale (not "future development")
4. No profit promises or guarantees
5. Clear non-investment disclosures

---

## 2. Private Sale Structure Options

### Option A: Direct Token Sale

#### Structure

**What Participants Buy:**
- HYPEAI tokens directly
- Immediate token transfer to wallet
- Tokens usable immediately (if platform live) or after launch

**Price Example:**
- Public sale price: $0.10 per HYPEAI
- Private sale price: $0.05 per HYPEAI (50% early adopter discount)
- Minimum purchase: $500 (10,000 tokens)
- Maximum purchase: $50,000 (1,000,000 tokens)

**Terms:**
- No lock-up period (immediate liquidity)
- OR: Vesting schedule (e.g., 25% at TGE, 75% over 12 months)

#### Advantages

‚úÖ **Simple:** Easy to understand ("buy tokens now")
‚úÖ **Direct:** No complex legal structures
‚úÖ **Immediate ownership:** Tokens transferred instantly
‚úÖ **Low admin:** Minimal ongoing obligations

#### Disadvantages

‚ùå **Higher legal risk:** May be viewed as investment/security
‚ùå **Investment perception:** Buyers focused on price appreciation, not utility
‚ùå **Regulatory scrutiny:** Direct token sales attract more attention
‚ùå **Marketing constraints:** Hard to avoid "investment" framing

#### Legal Risk Assessment

**Risk Level:** üü° **MODERATE-HIGH**

**Howey Test Considerations (security classification):**
1. ‚úÖ Investment of money - YES (clear)
2. ‚úÖ Common enterprise - YES (HypeAI platform)
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Expectation of profit - RISK (buyers may expect price increase)
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è From efforts of others - RISK (team develops platform)

**Mitigation Required:**
- Functional platform BEFORE sale (not "future promises")
- Extensive risk disclosures (no profit guarantee)
- Utility-focused marketing (avoid "investment" language)
- Vesting schedule (reduces speculation)
- Mandatory holding period or staking requirement

#### Compliance Requirements

**If using Direct Token Sale:**

**Documentation:**
- [ ] MiCA-compliant white paper (if >‚Ç¨1M or >150 holders)
- [ ] Private Sale Terms & Conditions
- [ ] Risk Disclosure Statement (comprehensive)
- [ ] Token Purchase Agreement
- [ ] KYC/AML procedures

**Operational:**
- [ ] Estonian Virtual Currency License (likely required)
- [ ] FIU registration
- [ ] KYC for all participants (no exceptions)
- [ ] Sanctions screening
- [ ] Transaction monitoring
- [ ] 5-year record retention

**Legal Opinion:**
- [ ] Obtain written legal opinion that HYPEAI = utility token (NOT security)
- [ ] Cost: ‚Ç¨5,000 - ‚Ç¨15,000 from Estonian crypto lawyer

#### Recommended Use Case

**Best for:**
- Experienced crypto teams with legal resources
- Projects with fully functional platform at sale
- When raising >‚Ç¨1M (already require full compliance)
- When team comfortable with moderate legal risk

**NOT recommended for:**
- First-time token issuers
- Pre-launch platforms (no utility yet)
- Budget-constrained projects
- Risk-averse teams

---

### Option B: SAFT-Like Structure (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens)

#### Structure

**What Participants Buy:**
- **Right to receive tokens** (not tokens themselves)
- Legal agreement (SAFT = "promise" of future tokens)
- Tokens delivered when platform launches or specific milestone reached

**How It Works:**

**Phase 1: Private Sale**
- Investor pays $5,000
- Receives SAFT contract
- Contract promises 100,000 HYPEAI tokens at TGE (Token Generation Event)

**Phase 2: Token Generation Event (TGE)**
- Platform launches
- Tokens minted and distributed
- SAFT holders receive tokens as per agreement

**Terms Example:**
- Purchase: SAFT for 100,000 tokens @ $0.05/token = $5,000
- Delivery: At TGE (estimated 3-6 months)
- Conversion: Automatic (1 SAFT = 100,000 tokens)
- Vesting: Optional (e.g., 20% at TGE, 80% over 12 months)

#### Advantages

‚úÖ **Delays token distribution:** Reduces immediate security risk
‚úÖ **Conditional delivery:** Tokens only if platform functional (proves utility)
‚úÖ **US precedent:** SAFT widely used in US ICOs (legal framework exists)
‚úÖ **Flexibility:** Can adjust token economics before TGE
‚úÖ **Investor protection:** Clearer terms than direct sale

#### Disadvantages

‚ùå **EU legal uncertainty:** SAFT not tested in EU/Estonian courts
‚ùå **May still be security:** SAFT itself could be investment contract
‚ùå **Complex documentation:** Requires sophisticated legal drafting
‚ùå **Delivery risk:** What if platform never launches? (refund obligations)
‚ùå **Tax uncertainty:** Unclear when taxable event occurs (purchase or delivery)

#### Legal Risk Assessment

**Risk Level:** üü° **MODERATE**

**EU/Estonian Considerations:**

**Potential Security Classification:**
- SAFT = investment contract (right to future tokens)
- Meets Howey Test factors (investment, common enterprise, profit expectation, efforts of others)
- May require securities prospectus in EU

**Potential Utility Classification:**
- SAFT = pre-purchase of services (forward contract)
- Not investment, but commercial transaction
- Delivery contingent on platform functionality (proves utility intent)

**Legal Gray Area:** EU law unclear on SAFT classification. Depends on:
1. Marketing language (investment vs service purchase)
2. Platform readiness at TGE
3. Token utility at delivery
4. Refund/cancellation terms

#### Compliance Requirements

**If using SAFT:**

**Documentation:**
- [ ] SAFT Legal Agreement (complex, EU-specific)
- [ ] Token Allocation Schedule
- [ ] TGE Trigger Conditions (when tokens delivered)
- [ ] Refund Policy (if TGE doesn't occur)
- [ ] Dispute Resolution (arbitration clause)
- [ ] Risk Disclosures (SAFT-specific risks)

**Legal Considerations:**
- [ ] Estonian contract law compliance
- [ ] Consumer protection regulations (if applicable)
- [ ] Securities law exemption analysis
- [ ] Tax treatment opinion (VAT, income tax)

**Operational:**
- [ ] Escrow arrangement (hold funds until TGE)
- [ ] KYC at both purchase AND delivery
- [ ] TGE announcement and notification system
- [ ] Token distribution mechanism (smart contract or manual)

#### Recommended Use Case

**Best for:**
- Pre-launch platforms (no utility yet, but will have)
- Teams familiar with US ICO structures
- When TGE is 3-6 months away (reasonable timeline)
- Sophisticated investor base (understand SAFT risks)

**NOT recommended for:**
- Teams without EU securities lawyer review
- Uncertain TGE timeline (delivery risk too high)
- General public sales (SAFT too complex)
- If equivalent to "futures" or "derivatives" under EU law

#### Critical: SAFT vs MiCA

**Question:** Does SAFT fall under MiCA or MiFID (securities)?

**Analysis:**

**MiCA Application:**
- If SAFT = "offer of crypto-asset before issuance" ‚Üí MiCA applies
- Still need white paper (if thresholds exceeded)
- AML/KYC required

**MiFID Application:**
- If SAFT = "transferable security" or "financial instrument" ‚Üí MiFID applies
- Requires prospectus + investment firm license
- MUCH heavier regulation

**Determining Factor:** Can SAFT be traded/transferred before TGE?
- **If YES:** More likely security (MiFID)
- **If NO (non-transferable):** More likely MiCA or commercial contract

**Recommendation:** Make SAFT **non-transferable** to reduce securities risk.

---

### Option C: Service Credit Model (RECOMMENDED)

#### Structure

**What Participants Buy:**
- **HypeAI Service Credits** (not "tokens" or "investment")
- Credits redeemable for platform services
- Convertible to HYPEAI tokens at launch (1 Credit = 1 HYPEAI)

**How It Works:**

**Phase 1: Private Sale (NOW)**
- User pays $500
- Receives 1,000 HypeAI Service Credits
- Credits stored in user account (database, not blockchain)
- User can check credit balance via dashboard

**Phase 2: Platform Launch**
- User option A: **Convert to tokens** (1,000 Credits ‚Üí 1,000 HYPEAI tokens)
- User option B: **Spend on services** (1,000 Credits = $1,000 worth of AI services)
- User option C: **Mix** (500 Credits ‚Üí tokens, 500 Credits ‚Üí services)

**Pricing Example:**
- Public token price: $1.00 per HYPEAI
- Public service price: 1 HYPEAI per AI service unit
- Private Sale: 1,000 Service Credits for $500 (50% discount)
- Value: $1,000 worth of services for $500 (prepayment discount)

#### Why This is NOT an Investment

**Key Legal Arguments:**

1. **Forward Purchase of Services**
   - Like buying airline miles before flight
   - Or prepaying for cloud computing credits
   - Commercial transaction, not investment

2. **Consumptive Intent**
   - Purpose: Access AI services (utility)
   - Not: Hold for price appreciation (speculation)
   - Credits USED, not held

3. **Service Defined NOW**
   - Catalog of AI services with clear pricing (in Credits)
   - Not "future development promises"
   - Services available at launch (concrete, not speculative)

4. **No Profit Guarantee**
   - Discount = bulk purchase benefit (like Costco)
   - NOT "investment return"
   - Risk: Services may not be valuable (no refund)

5. **Optional Token Conversion**
   - Tokens are delivery mechanism (technical)
   - Primary purpose: service access
   - Token form = user preference, not mandatory

#### Advantages

‚úÖ **Lowest legal risk:** Clearly NOT a security
‚úÖ **Consumer-friendly:** Easy to understand ("prepay for services")
‚úÖ **Utility emphasis:** Cannot be framed as investment
‚úÖ **Flexible:** Users choose how to use credits
‚úÖ **MiCA compliant:** Service vouchers, not crypto-assets (arguably)
‚úÖ **No license required:** May avoid Virtual Currency License (confirm with lawyer)
‚úÖ **Marketing freedom:** Can use "discount" language (not "ROI")

#### Disadvantages

‚ùå **Requires functional platform:** Must have service catalog ready
‚ùå **Conversion complexity:** Need system to convert credits ‚Üí tokens
‚ùå **User expectation management:** Some may still view as investment
‚ùå **Refund pressure:** If platform fails, users may demand refunds
‚ùå **Tax uncertainty:** VAT treatment of "future services" unclear

#### Legal Risk Assessment

**Risk Level:** üü¢ **LOW**

**Howey Test Analysis (US framework, but illustrative):**

1. Investment of money? **YES** (pay $500)
2. Common enterprise? **ARGUABLY NO** (buying services, not joining venture)
3. Expectation of profit? **NO** (buying services at discount, not profit)
4. From efforts of others? **NO** (services, not equity appreciation)

**Conclusion:** NOT a security. Service pre-purchase.

**EU Consumer Protection Considerations:**

**Directive 2011/83/EU (Consumer Rights):**
- Applies to "distance contracts" (online sales)
- 14-day cooling-off period (right to cancel)
- **Exception:** Digital content if user consents and waives right
- **HypeAI approach:** Users consent to waive cancellation right (digital credits)

**Unfair Terms Directive:**
- Terms must be fair and transparent
- No hidden fees or conditions
- Clear description of services
- Refund policy if platform never launches

#### Compliance Requirements

**If using Service Credit Model:**

**Documentation:**
- [ ] **Service Credit Terms & Conditions**
  - What credits can be used for
  - Conversion rules (Credits ‚Üí HYPEAI tokens)
  - Expiration (if any) - recommend NO expiration
  - Non-refundable clause (with exceptions)
  - Service catalog with pricing

- [ ] **Service Catalog** (CRITICAL)
  - List of AI services available
  - Price in Credits (e.g., 100 Credits = 1 hour AI agent time)
  - Service descriptions (clear, specific)
  - Availability timeline (at launch)

- [ ] **Risk Disclosures**
  - Platform may not launch (credits worthless)
  - Services may differ from descriptions
  - Token value not guaranteed
  - No refunds (except consumer protection law requires)

- [ ] **Privacy Policy** (GDPR compliant)
  - KYC data handling
  - Data retention (5 years for AML)
  - User rights (access, deletion, portability)

**Operational:**
- [ ] Credit tracking system (database)
- [ ] User dashboard (check balance, transaction history)
- [ ] Conversion mechanism (Credits ‚Üí Tokens at launch)
- [ ] Service redemption system (Credits ‚Üí AI services)
- [ ] KYC (still required for AML, even if not "crypto sale")

**Legal:**
- [ ] Estonian lawyer review (confirm NOT security, NOT crypto-asset)
- [ ] VAT analysis (are credits taxable? When?)
- [ ] Consumer protection compliance check
- [ ] Refund policy legal review

#### Service Catalog Example

**AI Services Available with HypeAI Credits:**

| Service | Description | Credit Cost |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **AI Agent Chat** | 1 hour conversational AI | 50 Credits |
| **Code Generation** | 1,000 lines of code | 100 Credits |
| **Data Analysis** | Process 1GB dataset | 75 Credits |
| **Image Generation** | 100 AI images | 60 Credits |
| **API Access (Basic)** | 10,000 API calls | 80 Credits |
| **API Access (Pro)** | 100,000 API calls | 500 Credits |
| **Custom AI Training** | Train personalized model | 300 Credits |
| **24/7 Support (1 month)** | Priority customer support | 200 Credits |

**Example Use Case:**
- User buys 1,000 Credits for $500 (50% discount)
- Could get: 20 hours of AI agent chat (normally $1,000 value)
- OR: Convert to 1,000 HYPEAI tokens (worth $1,000 at $1/token)
- Savings: $500 (50% early adopter discount)

**Key:** This is **service discount**, not "investment return."

#### Recommended Implementation

**Private Sale Page Language:**

**GOOD:**
> "Pre-purchase HypeAI platform services at 50% off. Buy Service Credits now, use them for AI services when platform launches. Credits convertible to HYPEAI tokens for convenience."

**BAD:**
> ‚ùå "Invest in HypeAI tokens at 50% discount. Early investors get 2x value at launch."

**Terms Summary Box:**
```
‚úÖ What you're buying: HypeAI Service Credits
‚úÖ What you get: Access to AI services (see catalog)
‚úÖ Discount: 50% off future public price
‚úÖ Conversion: 1 Credit = 1 HYPEAI token (optional)
‚úÖ Use: AI agent services, API access, platform features
‚ùå NOT an investment: No profit guarantee
‚ùå Risks: Platform may not launch, credits may become worthless
‚ùå No refunds: Except as required by law
```
