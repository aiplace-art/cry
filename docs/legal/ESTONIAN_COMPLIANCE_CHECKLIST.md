## CONTINGENCY PLANNING

### What If License is Delayed?

**Scenario:** Virtual Currency License approval takes 4-6 months (longer than expected).

**Options:**
1. **Delay Private Sale** until licensed (safest)
2. **Launch as Service Credits** (not tokens) to potentially avoid license requirement
   - Consult lawyer: Does Service Credit model exempt us from license?
   - If YES: Proceed with Service Credits, convert to tokens post-license
3. **Launch in different jurisdiction** (e.g., Switzerland, Malta) with faster licensing
   - Requires setting up new entity (expensive, time-consuming)
   - Not recommended unless critical

**Decision Tree:**
- If license needed + delayed → Option 1 or 2
- If license NOT needed for Service Credits → Option 2 (proceed)

### What If Legal Opinion is Negative?

**Scenario:** Lawyer concludes HYPEAI is security (not utility), or Private Sale violates Estonian law.

**Options:**
1. **Restructure token** to clearly be utility (add more consumptive use cases, remove any profit language)
2. **Use Service Credit Model** exclusively (don't call them tokens until utility proven)
3. **Obtain securities license** (expensive, 6-12 months, requires prospectus)
4. **Abandon Private Sale** (pivot to equity fundraising only)

**Decision:** Follow lawyer's recommendation. Do NOT proceed if lawyer says "high risk of securities violation."

### What If Regulator Challenges Us Post-Launch?

**Scenario:** Estonian FIU or FSA contacts HypeAI, claiming HYPEAI is security or Private Sale was illegal.

**Response:**
1. **Immediate:** Consult lawyer (do NOT respond to regulator without legal counsel)
2. **Evidence:** Provide legal opinion, documentation showing utility intent
3. **Remediation:** Offer to refund participants if regulator requires
4. **Negotiate:** Work with regulator to come into compliance (additional disclosures, license, etc.)
5. **Worst case:** Shut down Private Sale, refund participants, pay fine

**Mitigation:** Having legal opinion, compliant documentation, and good-faith effort = strong defense.
