**Pros**: Predictable costs
**Cons**: No performance incentive

**Pricing Guide:**

**Pricing Guide:**
- Base: 30-50% of flat rate
- Plus: $5-$50 per wallet activation
- Plus: $10-$100 per token purchase
- Plus: 0.5-2% of transaction volume

**Example Deal:**
- Micro-influencer base: $3,000

- Advisory board seat
- Ongoing input on strategy
- Often combined with token allocation

#### 5. **Hybrid (Most Common in 2025)**

## 9. Partnership Metrics & Tracking

### Key Metrics to Track

**Awareness Metrics:**
- Impressions
- Reach
- Video views
- Profile visits

**Engagement Metrics:**
- Likes, comments, shares
- Engagement rate
- Save/bookmark rate
- Click-through rate

**Conversion Metrics (Most Important):**
- Website visits (with UTM codes)
- Wallet activations (on-chain tracking)
- Token purchases (on-chain tracking)
- Community joins (Discord, Telegram)
- Newsletter signups

**ROI Calculation:**
```
ROI = (Revenue from campaign - Cost of campaign) / Cost of campaign × 100

Example:
Cost: $10,000 (influencer payment)
Result: 500 wallet activations → 200 token purchases → $50,000 trading volume
Revenue: $1,000 (fees) + $20,000 (token price appreciation impact)
ROI = ($21,000 - $10,000) / $10,000 × 100 = 110% ROI
```

### Tracking Tools

**On-Chain Tracking:**
- Dune Analytics dashboards
- Custom smart contract events
- Referral links with wallet tracking

**Off-Chain Tracking:**
- UTM codes for website
- Unique Discord invite links
- Telegram referral tracking
- Google Analytics

**Influencer-Specific Metrics:**
- Unique promo codes
- Affiliate links
- Custom landing pages
- Dedicated communication channels

## 10. Legal & Compliance Considerations

### Disclosure Requirements

**FTC Guidelines (US):**
- Must clearly disclose partnerships
- #ad or #sponsored must be prominent
- "I'm invested in this" must be disclosed
- Material connections must be revealed

**Good Disclosure Examples:**
✅ "Partnered with @HypeAI for this thread #ad"
✅ "Sponsored by HypeAI - I also hold $HYPE tokens"
✅ "Paid partnership with HypeAI"

**Bad Disclosure Examples:**
❌ Hidden disclosure at end of long thread
❌ Just emoji without clear meaning
❌ No disclosure at all

### Regulatory Risks

**SEC Concerns:**
- Token sales may be securities offerings
- Influencers may need to register
- Failure to disclose = potential fraud charges

**Kim Kardashian Case Study:**
- Promoted crypto without disclosure
- SEC fined $1.26M (2022)
- Permanent lesson for crypto influencer marketing

**How to Mitigate:**
1. ✅ Always require disclosure
2. ✅ Provide disclosure language in contract
3. ✅ Monitor compliance
4. ✅ Work with compliant influencers only
5. ✅ Consult legal counsel on partnerships

### Contract Essentials

**Every Influencer Contract Should Include:**
- Scope of work (specific deliverables)
- Compensation terms (amount, timing)
- Disclosure requirements
- Content approval process (or no approval)
- Exclusivity terms (can't promote competitors for X days)
- Term and termination clauses
- Clawback provisions (if they do harmful things)
