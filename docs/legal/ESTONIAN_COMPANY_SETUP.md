#### Step 3.2: Open Bank Account (DIFFICULT STEP)

**Problem:**
- Estonian banks hesitant to open accounts for crypto companies
- Even with e-Residency, often rejected

**Options:**

  - Success rate: ~30-50% for crypto projects

- **Swedbank, SEB**
  - Less crypto-friendly
  - Often reject crypto companies
  - Not recommended

**Option B: EMIs (Electronic Money Institutions)**
- **Wise Business** (formerly TransferWise)
  - Accept some crypto companies (case-by-case)
