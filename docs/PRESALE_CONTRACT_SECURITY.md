## 🔍 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Implementation

1. **Price Feeds**: Manual updates required. For production, integrate Chainlink oracles.
2. **Refund Mechanism**: Simplified to return equivalent USD value in ETH. Production should track original payment method.
3. **Multisig**: Basic implementation. Consider using Gnosis Safe for production.
4. **Gas Costs**: High for complex operations. Consider layer 2 solutions for lower fees.

### Recommended Improvements

1. **Oracle Integration**: Replace manual price feeds with Chainlink Price Feeds
2. **Layer 2 Support**: Deploy on Arbitrum/Optimism for lower gas costs
3. **Automated KYC**: Integrate with on-chain identity solutions
4. **Timelock Contract**: Use OpenZeppelin's TimelockController for withdrawals
5. **Gnosis Safe**: Replace basic multisig with Gnosis Safe

### Alerting Rules

- Alert if single purchase >$9k
- Alert if soft cap reached
- Alert if hard cap within 10%

## 🔐 Incident Response Plan

### Security Incident Levels

**Level 1 - Low**: Minor issues, no immediate risk
- Example: Failed transaction, user error
- Response: Monitor, provide support

**Level 2 - Medium**: Potential vulnerability, no active exploit
- Example: Unusual transaction pattern
- Response: Investigate, pause if necessary

**Level 3 - High**: Active exploit or critical vulnerability
- Example: Reentrancy attack detected
- Response: Pause immediately, investigate, communicate

**Level 4 - Critical**: Funds at risk
- Example: Successful exploit stealing funds
- Response: Emergency procedures, coordinate with exchanges, law enforcement

### Incident Response Steps

1. **Detect**: Monitoring systems identify issue
2. **Assess**: Determine severity and impact
3. **Contain**: Pause contract if necessary
4. **Investigate**: Root cause analysis
5. **Communicate**: Notify users transparently
6. **Resolve**: Fix vulnerability, resume operations
7. **Learn**: Post-mortem, update procedures
