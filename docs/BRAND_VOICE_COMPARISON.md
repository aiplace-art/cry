- **Overconfident**: "Guaranteed", "100% safe", "Impossible to fail"
- **Hype**: "To the moon!", "🚀🚀🚀", "LFG!!!"

### ✅ RIGHT TONE

## 🌐 Russian vs. English Consistency

### ❌ WRONG (Inconsistent)
```
English: "Where AI Meets Opportunity"
Russian: "Не надежда. Математика."
(These contradict each other!)
```

### ✅ RIGHT (Consistent)
```
English: "AI Predictions. On-Chain Proof. 85% Accuracy."
Russian: "Не надежда. Математика. 85% точность."

English: "Mathematical Trading Intelligence"
Russian: "Математический торговый интеллект"

English: "Proven Results. No Promises."
Russian: "Доказанные результаты. Без обещаний."
```

**Why**: Brand voice must be identical across languages.

## 📝 Writing Rules Cheat Sheet

### ALWAYS:
✅ Use precise numbers ("85%", "1B tokens", "62% APY")
✅ Cite sources and proof links
✅ Disclose risks honestly
✅ Use technical specifics ("LSTM", "Polygon", "Smart Contracts")
✅ Say "Projected" or "Estimated" for future claims
✅ Include "Not financial advice"
✅ Link to verification (blockchain explorers, GitHub, audits)

### NEVER:
❌ Promise wealth ("millionaire", "get rich", "financial freedom")
❌ Use vague hope words ("opportunity", "future", "success")
❌ Make guarantees ("guaranteed profits", "risk-free", "100% safe")
❌ Create urgency ("limited time", "don't miss out", "FOMO")
❌ Hide risks or limitations
❌ Use unverifiable superlatives ("best", "#1", "revolutionary")
❌ Present projections as facts

## 🎯 The Ultimate Test

**Before publishing ANY content, ask:**

1. **Data Test**: "Can I prove this with numbers/links?"
   - If NO → Rewrite or remove

2. **Risk Test**: "Am I hiding any downsides?"
   - If YES → Add disclaimers

3. **Hope Test**: "Does this rely on emotion or facts?"
   - If emotion → Rewrite with facts

4. **Russian Test**: "Would this translate to 'Не надежда. Математика.'?"
   - If NO → Doesn't match our brand

5. **Legal Test**: "Could SEC/regulators call this misleading?"
   - If MAYBE → Add disclaimers or rewrite
