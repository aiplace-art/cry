By adding 13-18 specialized agents focused on high-demand B2C services (business plans, thesis support, financial planning) and high-margin B2B enterprise services (audits, market research, AI automation), revenue can grow from $2.4M to $25M+ within 24 months. EU market entry via Estonia provides cost-effective expansion with 40% lower costs than Nordic competitors.",

      "Quality delivery - AI-generated work must match or exceed human consultants",
      "Enterprise sales capability - need experienced BDRs for $50K+ deals",
