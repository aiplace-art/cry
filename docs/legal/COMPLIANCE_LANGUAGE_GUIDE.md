# HypeAI Private Sale - Compliant vs Non-Compliant Language Guide

## Purpose

This document provides clear examples of COMPLIANT and NON-COMPLIANT marketing/communication language for the HypeAI Private Sale. ALL team members, affiliates, and partners must follow these guidelines to avoid securities classification and regulatory violations.

**Golden Rule:** When in doubt, emphasize UTILITY (service access) and NEVER promise PROFIT (investment returns).

---

## 1. FORBIDDEN WORDS AND PHRASES

### 1.1 Investment Language (NEVER USE)

**Completely Forbidden:**

| "Expected value of $X by 2027" | Price forecast | "Future value unknown and unpredictable" |

### 1.3 Team Effort Language (AVOID - Howey Element #4)

**Minimize or Reframe:**

| ⚠️ RISKY | Why It's Problematic | ✅ BETTER |
|---------|---------------------|----------|
| "Our team will grow your investment" | Profit from efforts of others (Howey #4) | "Our team is building the platform you can use with HYPEAI tokens" |

---

## 2. COMPLIANT LANGUAGE (ALWAYS USE)

### 2.1 Utility Framing

**Safe and Effective:**

| ✅ ALWAYS SAY | Why It's Compliant | Context |
|--------------|-------------------|---------|
| "Pre-purchase AI platform services" | Service transaction, not investment | Private Sale description |
| "Buy Service Credits to access AI tools" | Clear utility purpose | Landing page copy |
| "Use HYPEAI tokens to pay for services" | Consumptive utility | Token usage explanation |
| "Tokens are burned when used for services" | Deflationary mechanism (factual) | Tokenomics explanation |
| "Early adopters receive 50% service discount" | Commercial discount (like bulk purchase) | Private Sale benefit |
| "Access AI agents, APIs, and data analysis" | Concrete utility | Service description |
| "Participate in DAO governance voting" | Utility benefit (platform control) | Governance explanation |
| "Lock tokens to unlock premium service tiers" | Staking utility (not profit) | Staking mechanism |
| "Hold tokens for fee discounts" | Utility incentive | Holding benefit |

### 2.2 Risk Language (REQUIRED)

| "Platform may not succeed or attract users" | Business risk disclosure | Risk section |
| "Consult legal, tax, and financial advisors" | Professional advice disclaimer | Footer, Terms |

### 2.3 Service-Focused Language

**Emphasize Utility:**

| ✅ SERVICE LANGUAGE | Message | Use Case |
|--------------------|---------|----------|
| "AI Chat: 50 HYPEAI per hour" | Concrete pricing | Service catalog |
| "Generate 1,000 lines of code: 100 HYPEAI" | Specific utility | Service examples |
| "Staking 10,000 HYPEAI unlocks Gold tier (20% service discount)" | Service benefit (not profit) | Staking explanation |
| "DAO members vote on platform features and pricing" | Governance utility | DAO description |

[Invest Now]
```

**Why First is OK, Second is Illegal:**
- First: Service focus, clear disclaimers, no profit promises
- Second: Investment framing, price guarantees, passive income promise (all illegal)

### 3.2 Social Media Posts

**COMPLIANT TWEET:**

```
✅ "HypeAI Private Sale now open!

Pre-purchase AI platform services at 50% discount. Use HYPEAI tokens for AI agents,
APIs, and data tools.

NOT an investment. High risk. See disclosures: [link]

#AI #HypeAI #Utility"
```

**NON-COMPLIANT TWEET (DO NOT USE):**

```
❌ "HypeAI ICO LIVE! 🚀🌙

Invest now for 2x returns! Token will MOON! 💰💰
Early investors get RICH!
Don't miss out! 🤑

#HypeAI #ToTheMoon #Investment #Crypto"
```

**Guidance:**
- Avoid emoji that imply wealth (💰, 🤑, 💵, 🏦)
- OK to use tech emoji (🚀, 💡, 🤖, but be careful with 🚀🌙 combo = "moon" = speculation)
- Never use hashtags like #Investment, #ROI, #GetRich

### 3.3 Email Campaign

**COMPLIANT EMAIL:**

```
Subject: HypeAI Service Credits - 50% Early Access Discount

Hi [Name],

You're invited to pre-purchase HypeAI platform services before our public launch.

🎯 What HypeAI Offers:

This email is about a utility token offering, not a securities offering. Consult
legal and financial advisors before purchasing.
```

**NON-COMPLIANT EMAIL (DO NOT USE):**

```
❌ Subject: Get Rich with HypeAI - Limited Investment Opportunity!

Make money with HypeAI tokens! Our expert team will grow your investment.
Early investors see 10x returns!

Invest now: [link]

To the moon! 🚀🌙
```

**Key Differences:**
- Compliant: Service focus, disclaimers, risk warnings
- Non-compliant: Investment language, profit promises, no disclaimers

### 3.4 Customer Support Responses

**SCENARIO:** Customer asks: "Is this a good investment?"

**❌ WRONG RESPONSE:**
> "Yes! HypeAI is a great investment. Token price will go up and you'll make money!"

**✅ CORRECT RESPONSE:**
> "HypeAI Service Credits are NOT an investment. They are for pre-purchasing access
> to our AI platform services. We make no promises about token value, profit, or returns.
> This is a high-risk purchase and credits may become worthless. Please read our Risk
> Disclosures [link] and consult with financial advisors before purchasing. If you're
> looking for an investment, HypeAI Service Credits are not suitable."

**SCENARIO:** Customer asks: "How much profit will I make?"

**❌ WRONG RESPONSE:**
> "You could make 5x-10x if token reaches $1! That's $500 becoming $5,000!"

**✅ CORRECT RESPONSE:**
> "We cannot and do not make any profit predictions. HYPEAI tokens are utility tokens
> for platform services, not investments. Future token price (if any) depends on market
> demand, which is completely uncertain. Tokens may have $0 value. Please only purchase
> if you need the services, not for profit expectations."

**SCENARIO:** Customer asks: "When will token price go up?"

**❌ WRONG RESPONSE:**
> "After we launch on Binance and Coinbase, price will moon!"

**✅ CORRECT RESPONSE:**
> "We have no control over or predictions about token price. Token value depends on
> market demand for utility (platform services), which is unpredictable. Price may
> never increase and may remain at $0. Please do not purchase expecting price appreciation."

## 5. LINGUISTIC EQUIVALENTS (SAFE SUBSTITUTIONS)

### Replace Investment Language with Utility Language

| ❌ INVESTMENT TERM | ✅ UTILITY REPLACEMENT |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Invest | Pre-purchase, Buy, Acquire |
| Investment | Purchase, Service Pre-Sale, Early Access |
| Profit | Benefit, Value, Savings, Discount |
| Return | Benefit, Service Access, Utility Value |
| ROI | Service Value, Cost Savings |
| Yield | Service Benefits, Staking Rewards (if referring to discounts) |
| Earnings | Benefits, Rewards (non-financial) |
| Dividend | N/A (never applicable) |
| Equity | N/A (never applicable) |
| Shareholder | Token Holder, Community Member |
| Price will increase | Price is uncertain (may be $0) |
| Guaranteed | No guarantees (explicitly disclaim) |
| Expected value of $X | Value is unpredictable |
| Passive income | Active usage for services |
| Make money | Get value from services, Save on costs |

### Reframe Investment Concepts as Utility

| ❌ INVESTMENT CONCEPT | ✅ UTILITY REFRAME |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| "Buy low, sell high" | "Pre-purchase services at discount, use when needed" |
| "Hold for gains" | "Hold for fee discounts and governance voting" |
| "Staking for returns" | "Staking to unlock premium service tiers" |
| "Token burn increases value" | "Token burn reduces supply as services are consumed (deflationary mechanism)" |
| "Our team will make you money" | "Our team provides AI services you can use" |
| "Limited supply = price increase" | "Limited supply = scarcity, but demand uncertain (price may be $0)" |

---

## 6. VISUAL CONTENT GUIDELINES

### 6.1 Infographics and Images

**COMPLIANT:**
- ✅ Charts showing service catalog and pricing
- ✅ Diagrams explaining burn mechanism (factual)
- ✅ Roadmap showing platform features (not "token price targets")
- ✅ Team photos with "Building AI platform" caption (not "Making you rich")

**NON-COMPLIANT:**
- ❌ Charts with "Price Prediction: $10 by 2027"
- ❌ Images of money, lambos, mansions (wealth association)
- ❌ "10x ROI" graphics
- ❌ Before/After wealth comparison

### 6.2 Video Content

**COMPLIANT SCRIPT EXAMPLE:**

```
"Welcome to HypeAI! We're building an AI platform where you can access chat agents,
code generation, and data analysis. You can pre-purchase services at a 50% discount
during our Private Sale.

HYPEAI tokens are used to pay for services. They're burned when used, creating a
deflationary mechanism.

IMPORTANT: This is NOT an investment. Tokens may become worthless. High risk -
only purchase if you can afford total loss.

Learn more at hypeai.com"
```

**NON-COMPLIANT SCRIPT (DO NOT USE):**

```
❌ "Invest in HypeAI and get rich! Our token will 10x! Early investors make the
most money! Don't miss out on this investment opportunity! To the moon!"
```

**Verbal Disclaimers in Videos:**
- Must verbally state "NOT an investment" (not just text on screen)
- Verbal risk warning required (at least brief: "High risk, may lose everything")
- Text disclaimers on screen for entire video (not just 2 seconds)

### 6.3 Memes and Community Content

**Guidance:**
- Community may create memes (hard to control)
- HypeAI official accounts should NOT share memes with investment framing
- OK to share: Utility-focused memes (AI humor, platform features)
- NOT OK: Price speculation memes ("HYPEAI to $10!"), wealth memes (lambos)

**If Community Posts Non-Compliant Memes:**
- Do NOT repost or like from official accounts
- Consider: Community guidelines prohibiting investment language (enforce with bans if needed)
- Acceptable: General crypto humor (not HypeAI-specific investment claims)

---

## 7. TRANSLATIONS AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETING

### 7.1 Non-English Languages

**Critical:** Utility vs investment distinction must be clear in ALL languages.

**Common Translation Errors:**

| Language | ❌ WRONG | ✅ CORRECT |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| **Russian** | "Инвестируйте в HypeAI" (Invest in HypeAI) | "Приобретите услуги HypeAI" (Purchase HypeAI services) |
| **Chinese** | "投资 HypeAI 赚钱" (Invest in HypeAI to make money) | "购买 HypeAI 服务" (Buy HypeAI services) |
| **Spanish** | "Invierte en HypeAI" (Invest in HypeAI) | "Compra servicios de HypeAI" (Buy HypeAI services) |
| **German** | "Investition in HypeAI" (Investment in HypeAI) | "Kauf von HypeAI-Diensten" (Purchase of HypeAI services) |

**Process:**
1. Draft in English (following this guide)
2. Translate with professional translator (not Google Translate for legal terms)
3. Native speaker review (is utility vs investment distinction clear?)
4. Compliance Officer approval (even for translations)

**Disclaimer Translation:**
- "NOT an investment" must be translated accurately (critical phrase)
- Risk warnings cannot be softened in translation

### 7.2 Cultural Considerations

**US Market:** Exclude entirely (SEC jurisdiction too risky)

**EU Markets:** Follow MiCA guidelines (utility framing, no investment promises)

**Asian Markets (Allowed Jurisdictions):**
- Some cultures more investment-focused (be extra careful with language)
- Emphasize utility even more strongly
- Consider excluding if translation compliance too difficult

**Recommendation:** Start with English-speaking markets (UK, Australia, Canada - but check local laws) before expanding to non-English markets.

---

## 8. PARTNER AND AFFILIATE COMPLIANCE

### 8.1 Affiliate Marketing Rules

**If HypeAI Uses Affiliates (Referral Partners):**

**Mandatory:**
- Affiliates must sign compliance agreement (use only approved language)
- Provide affiliates with approved content templates (compliant posts, emails)
- Prohibit investment language (contractual violation = termination)
- Monitor affiliate content (random audits)

**Approved Affiliate Language:**
> "HypeAI Private Sale - Pre-purchase AI services at 50% off. Utility token for platform access. NOT an investment. High risk. [my affiliate link]"

**Prohibited Affiliate Language:**
> ❌ "Invest in HypeAI with my link and get rich! 10x returns guaranteed!"

**Enforcement:**
- Affiliate violates → Terminate + demand content removal
- HypeAI not responsible for affiliate content (but should monitor and act quickly)

### 8.2 Influencer Partnerships

**If Working with Crypto Influencers:**

**Contract Must Include:**
- "You agree to NOT frame HypeAI as investment"
- "You agree to include disclaimer: NOT an investment, high risk"
- "You agree HypeAI reviews all content before posting"
- "Violation = termination + potential legal action"

**Content Review:**
- Influencer submits draft (video script, post copy)
- Compliance Officer reviews
- Approve with edits, or reject
- Influencer posts only after approval

**High Risk:** Influencers often use hype language. Consider NOT using influencers if compliance risk too high.

---

## 9. INTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS COMPLIANCE

### 9.1 Team Slack/Discord

**Private Channels Still Matter:**
- Internal messages can be subpoenaed in litigation or regulatory investigation
- Team should use compliant language even in private (habit formation)

**Guidance:**
- OK: "We're building a great AI platform. Users will love our services."
- NOT OK: "We're gonna make our investors rich! Token will moon!"

**Why:** If regulator investigates, internal messages showing "we knew it was investment" = smoking gun.

### 9.2 Investor Presentations (Equity Investors, Not Token Holders)

**For Equity Fundraising (Separate from Token Sale):**

**CAN Discuss (Equity Context):**
- Company revenue projections
- Business model and profitability
- Equity valuation
- Exit strategy (acquisition, IPO)

**CANNOT Mix:**
- Do NOT say "Token price will increase company value" (conflates equity and tokens)
- Do NOT promise equity investors "token pump will increase equity value"
- Keep equity and token discussions SEPARATE

**Rationale:** Equity investors get company ownership (securities). Token holders get utility (not securities). Mixing these = regulatory nightmare.

---

## 10. QUICK REFERENCE: DOS AND DON'TS

### DO ✅

- ✅ Emphasize service utility (AI tools, APIs, platform access)
- ✅ Describe burn mechanism factually (tokens consumed)
- ✅ Highlight DAO governance (platform control)
- ✅ Offer service discounts (50% early adopter discount)
- ✅ Include "NOT an investment" disclaimer everywhere
- ✅ Warn about risks (may lose all funds)
- ✅ Use terms: Pre-purchase, Buy, Service Credits, Utility
- ✅ Focus on functional platform (what users can DO with tokens)
- ✅ Encourage service usage (use tokens, don't just hold)
- ✅ Consult Compliance Officer before publishing content

### DON'T ❌

- ❌ Use words: Invest, Profit, ROI, Returns, Yield, Dividend
- ❌ Promise price increases ("will reach $10")
- ❌ Guarantee value ("floor price of $1")
- ❌ Emphasize speculation ("buy low, sell high")
- ❌ Market passive income ("earn while you sleep")
- ❌ Compare to stocks or securities
- ❌ Show wealth imagery (lambos, mansions, stacks of cash)
- ❌ Hype price targets ("to the moon")
- ❌ Claim team will make buyers money
- ❌ Post without Compliance Officer approval

---

## 11. COMPLIANCE OFFICER AUTHORITY

### Final Decision Maker

**Compliance Officer Has Authority To:**
- ✅ Reject any content (even if CEO approves)
- ✅ Halt marketing campaign if non-compliant
- ✅ Terminate affiliate/partner for violations
- ✅ Require revision of content (no matter how minor the issue)
- ✅ Delay product launch if compliance not ready

**No Overrides:** Business objectives DO NOT override compliance. Legal risk > revenue.

### Escalation Process

**If Team Disagrees with Compliance Officer:**

1. Team member raises concern with Compliance Officer (explain business need)
2. Compliance Officer explains legal risk
3. If unresolved: Escalate to CEO + Estonian lawyer (joint decision)
4. Lawyer's opinion = final (not overridden by business preferences)

**Example:**
- Marketing wants to use "Invest in HypeAI for high returns"
- Compliance Officer: "Absolutely not - securities violation"
- Marketing: "But it will generate more sales!"
- Compliance Officer: "Legal risk of SEC/ESMA action is existential. Revenue doesn't matter if we're shut down."
- Decision: Compliance Officer wins. Revise to "Pre-purchase HypeAI services."

---

## 12. TRAINING AND CERTIFICATION

### Mandatory Training

**All Staff Must Complete:**
- Initial training: Before starting any public-facing work (1-2 hours)
- Annual refresher: Every year (1 hour)
- Ad-hoc training: When regulations change or violations occur

**Training Content:**
- Why investment language is illegal (securities law basics)
- Compliant vs non-compliant examples (this guide)
- Quiz: Identify violations in sample content (must score 90%+)

**Certification:**
- Sign acknowledgment: "I have read and understood the Compliance Language Guide. I agree to follow it in all communications."
- Keep signed forms on file (regulatory audit evidence)

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

**Individual:**
- Violation = warning or termination (see Section 4)

**Company:**
- SEC/ESMA investigation (costly, time-consuming)
- Fines (€100,000 - €5,000,000 or more)
- Forced shutdown or token redemption
- Criminal liability (fraud, unregistered securities offering)

**Takeaway:** Compliance is not optional. Every word matters.
