## Appendix: Quick Security Rules

### The 5 Golden Rules

1. **NEVER trust user input** - Validate and sanitize everything
2. **ALWAYS use parameterized queries** - Prevent SQL injection
3. **NEVER expose sensitive data** - Encrypt, hash, redact
4. **ALWAYS implement rate limiting** - Prevent abuse
5. **NEVER skip security tests** - Test every security control

### The 3 Security Principles

1. **Defense in Depth** - Multiple layers of security
2. **Least Privilege** - Minimal necessary access
3. **Fail Secure** - Default to secure state on error

### When in Doubt

- Refer to security-quick-reference.md
- Request security review
- Ask security team
- Follow industry best practices
- Err on the side of caution
